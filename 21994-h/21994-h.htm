<p>There may be children whose education has been so neglected 
that they have not read <i>Prince Prigio</i>.&nbsp; As this new 
story is about Prince Prigio&rsquo;s son, Ricardo, you are to 
learn that Prigio was the child and heir of Grognio, King of 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; The fairies gave the little Prince cleverness, 
beauty, courage; but one wicked fairy added, &ldquo;You shall be 
<i>too</i> clever.&rdquo;&nbsp; His mother, the queen, hid away 
in a cupboard all the fairy presents,&mdash;the <!-- page x--><a 
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>Sword of 
Sharpness, the Seven-League Boots, the Wishing Cap, and many 
other useful and delightful gifts, in which her Majesty did not 
believe!&nbsp; But after Prince Prigio had become universally 
disliked and deserted, because he was so very clever and 
conceited, he happened to find all the fairy presents in the old 
turret chamber where they had been thrown.&nbsp; By means of 
these he delivered his country from a dreadful Red-Hot Beast, 
called the Firedrake, and, in addition to many other triumphs, he
married the good and beautiful Lady Rosalind.&nbsp; His love for 
her taught him not to be conceited, though he did not cease to be
extremely clever and fond of reading.</p>
<p>When this new story begins the Prince has succeeded to the 
crown, on the death of King Grognio, and is unhappy about his own
son, Prince Ricardo, who is not clever, and who hates 
books!&nbsp; The story tells of Ricardo&rsquo;s <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>adventures: 
how he tried to bring back Prince Charlie to England, how he 
failed; how he dealt with the odious old Yellow Dwarf; how he was
aided by the fair magician, the Princess Jaqueline; how they both
fell into a dreadful trouble; how King Prigio saved them; and how
Jaqueline&rsquo;s dear and royal papa was discovered; with the 
end of all these adventures.&nbsp; The moral of the story will 
easily be discovered by the youngest reader, or, if not, it does 
not much matter.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that 
boy!&rdquo; said King Prigio of Pantouflia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t know, my dear,&rdquo; said 
Queen Rosalind, his illustrious consort, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
what is to be done.&nbsp; You are so clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>The king and queen were sitting in the royal library, of
which the shelves were full of the most delightful fairy books in
all languages, all equally familiar to King Prigio.&nbsp; The 
queen could not read most of them herself, but the king used to 
read them aloud to her.&nbsp; A good many years had 
passed&mdash;seventeen, in fact&mdash;since Queen Rosalind was 
married, but you would not think it to look at her.&nbsp; Her 
grey eyes were as kind and soft and beautiful, her dark hair as 
dark, and her pretty colour as like a white rose blushing, as on 
the day when she was a bride.&nbsp; And she was as fond of the 
king as when he was only Prince Prigio, and he was as fond of her
as on the night when he first met her at the ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with Dick,&rdquo; 
said the king.</p>
<p>He meant his son, Prince Ricardo, but he called him Dick in 
private.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the fault of his 
education,&rdquo; his Majesty went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have not 
brought him up rightly.&nbsp; These fairy books are at the bottom
of his provoking behaviour,&rdquo; and he glanced round the 
shelves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, when <i>I</i> was a boy, my dear 
mother tried to prevent me from reading fairy books, because she 
did not believe in fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was wrong, you know,&rdquo; said the 
queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, if it had not been for all these fairy 
presents, the Cap of Darkness and all the rest of them, you never
could have killed the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast, and&mdash;you
never could have married me,&rdquo; the queen added, in a happy 
whisper, blushing beautifully, for that was a foolish habit of 
hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and 
therefore I thought it best to bring Dick up on fairy books, that
he might know what is right, and have no nonsense about 
him.&nbsp; But perhaps the thing has been overdone; at all 
events, it is <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>not a success.&nbsp; I wonder if 
fathers and sons will ever understand each other, and get on well
together?&nbsp; There was my poor father, King Grognio, he wanted
me to take to adventures, like other princes, fighting 
Firedrakes, and so forth; and I did not care for it, till 
<i>you</i> set me on,&rdquo; and he looked very kindly at her 
Majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, here&rsquo;s Dick,&rdquo; the 
monarch continued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hold him back.&nbsp; He 
is always after a giant, or a dragon, or a magician, as the case 
may be; he will certainly be ploughed for his examination at 
College.&nbsp; Never opens a book.&nbsp; What does he care, off 
after every adventure he can hear about?&nbsp; An idle, restless 
youth!&nbsp; Ah, my poor country, when I am gone, what may not be
your misfortunes under Ricardo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his Majesty sighed, and seemed plunged in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not going yet, my dear,&rdquo; said the 
queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why you are not forty!&nbsp; And <!-- page 
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>young
people will be young people.&nbsp; You were quite proud when poor
Dick came home with his first brace of gigantic fierce birds, 
killed off his own sword, and with such a pretty princess he had 
rescued&mdash;dear Jaqueline?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she is like a 
daughter to me.&nbsp; I cannot do without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she were a daughter-in-law; I wish Dick would 
take a fancy to marry her,&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;A 
nicer girl I never saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so accomplished,&rdquo; added Queen Rosalind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That girl can turn herself into anything&mdash;a mouse, a 
fly, a lion, a wheelbarrow, a church!&nbsp; I never knew such 
talent for magic.&nbsp; Of course she had the <i>best</i> of 
teachers, the Fairy Paribanou herself; but very few girls, in our
time, devote so many hours to <i>practice</i> as dear 
Jaqueline.&nbsp; Even now, when she is out of the schoolroom, she
still practises her scales.&nbsp; I saw her turning little Dollie
into a fish and <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>back again in the bath-room last 
night.&nbsp; The child was delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these times, you must know, princesses learned magic, just 
as they learn the piano nowadays; but they had their music 
lessons too, dancing, calisthenics, and the use of the 
globes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a dear, good girl,&rdquo; said the 
king; &ldquo;yet she looks melancholy.&nbsp; I believe, myself, 
that if Ricardo asked her to marry him, she would not say 
&lsquo;No.&rsquo; But that&rsquo;s just one of the things I 
object to most in Dick.&nbsp; Round the world he goes, rescuing 
ladies from every kind of horror&mdash;from dragons, giants, 
cannibals, magicians; and then, when a girl naturally expects to 
be married to him, as is usual, off he rides!&nbsp; He has no 
more heart than a flounder.&nbsp; Why, at his age 
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At his age, my dear, you were so hard-hearted that you 
were quite a proverb.&nbsp; Why, <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>I have been 
told that you used to ask girls dreadful puzzling questions, like
&lsquo;Who was C&aelig;sar Borgia?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do 
you know of Edwin and Morcar?&rsquo; and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not seen <i>you</i> then,&rdquo; said the 
king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ricardo has not seen <i>her</i>, whoever she may 
be.&nbsp; Besides, he can&rsquo;t possibly marry all of 
them.&nbsp; And I think a girl should consider herself lucky if 
she is saved from a dragon or a giant, without expecting to be 
married next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but it is usual,&rdquo; said the king, 
&ldquo;and their families expect it, and keep sending ambassadors
to know what Dick&rsquo;s intentions are.&nbsp; I would not mind 
it all so very much if he killed the monsters off his own sword, 
as he did that first brace, in fair fight.&nbsp; But ever since 
he found his way into that closet where the fairy presents lie, 
everything has been made too easy for him.&nbsp; It is a royal 
road to glory, or <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>giant-slaying made easy.&nbsp; In his
Cap of Darkness a poor brute of a dragon can&rsquo;t see 
him.&nbsp; In his Shoes of Swiftness the giants can&rsquo;t catch
him.&nbsp; His Sword of Sharpness would cut any oak asunder at a 
blow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were very glad of them when you made the 
Ice-beast and the Fire-beast fight and kill each other,&rdquo; 
said the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; but it wanted some wit, if I may say so, 
to do <i>that</i>, and Dick just goes at it hammer and tongs: 
anybody could do it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s <i>intellect</i> I miss in 
Ricardo.&nbsp; How am I to know whether he could make a good 
fight for it without all these fairy things?&nbsp; I wonder what 
the young rogue is about to-day?&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be late for 
dinner, as usual, I daresay.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stand want of 
punctuality at meals,&rdquo; remarked his Majesty, which is a 
sign that he was growing old after all; for where is the fun of 
being expected always to come home in time for dinner when, 
perhaps, <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>you are fishing, and the trout are 
rising splendidly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young people will be young people,&rdquo; said the 
queen.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are anxious about him, why don&rsquo;t
you look for him in the magic crystal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the magic crystal was a fairy present, a great ball of 
glass in which, if you looked, you saw the person you wanted to 
see, and what he was doing, however far away he might be, if he 
was on the earth at all. <a name="citation21"></a><a 
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a look at it,&rdquo; said the 
king; &ldquo;it only wants three-quarters of an hour to 
dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Majesty rose, and walked to the crystal globe, which was 
in a stand, like other globes.&nbsp; He stared into it, he turned
it round and round, and Queen Rosalind saw him grow quite pale as
he gazed.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him anywhere,&rdquo; said the 
king, &ldquo;and I have looked everywhere.&nbsp; I do hope 
nothing has happened to the boy.&nbsp; He is so careless.&nbsp; 
If he dropped his Cap of Darkness in a fight with a giant, why 
who knows what might occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;Gio, how you frighten me!&rdquo; said the 
queen.</p>
<p>King Prigio was still turning the crystal globe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I see a beautiful 
princess, fastened by iron chains to a rock beside the sea, in a 
lonely place.&nbsp; They must have fixed her up as a sacrifice to
a sea-monster, like what&rsquo;s-her-name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proves how anxious he was, or, being so clever and 
learned, he would have remembered that her name was 
Andromeda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet Dick is not far off, where there is an adventure 
on hand.&nbsp; But where on earth can <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>he be? . . 
.&nbsp; My word!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed the monarch, in 
obvious excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; cried the queen, with all the 
anxiety of a mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the sea where the girl is, has turned all red as 
blood!&rdquo; exclaimed the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now it is all 
being churned up by the tail of a tremendous monster.&nbsp; He is
a whopper!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s coming on shore; the girl is 
fainting.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s out on shore!&nbsp; He is extremely 
poorly, blood rushing from his open jaws.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
dying!&nbsp; And, hooray! here&rsquo;s Dick coming out of his 
enormous mouth, all in armour set with sharp spikes, and a sword 
in his hand.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s covered with blood, but he&rsquo;s 
well and hearty.&nbsp; He must have been swallowed by the brute, 
and cut him up inside.&nbsp; Now he&rsquo;s cutting the 
beast&rsquo;s head off.&nbsp; Now he&rsquo;s gone to the 
princess; a very neat bow he has made her.&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s 
manners are positively improving!&nbsp; Now he&rsquo;s cutting 
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>her iron chains off with the Sword of Sharpness.&nbsp; 
And now he&rsquo;s made her another bow, and he&rsquo;s actually 
taking leave of her.&nbsp; Poor thing!&nbsp; How disappointed she
is looking.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s so pretty, too.&nbsp; I say, 
Rosalind, shall I shout to him through the magic horn, and tell 
him to bring her home here, on the magic carpet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, dear; the palace is quite full,&rdquo; 
said the queen.&nbsp; But the real reason was that she wanted 
Ricardo to marry her favourite Princess Jaqueline, and she did 
not wish the new princess to come in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like,&rdquo; said the king, who knew what was in
her mind very well.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, I see her own people 
coming for her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for her, but it can&rsquo;t
be helped, and Dick is half-way home by now on the Shoes of 
Swiftness.&nbsp; I daresay he will not keep dinner waiting after 
all.&nbsp; But what a fright the boy has given me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>At this moment a whirring in the air and a joyous shout 
were heard.&nbsp; It was Prince Ricardo flying home on his 
Seven-league Boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Ross!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;just weigh this 
beast&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a splendid day with a 
sea-monster.&nbsp; Get the head stuffed, will you?&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;ll have it set up in the billiard-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Master Dick&mdash;I mean your Royal 
Highness,&rdquo; said Ross, a Highland keeper, who had not 
previously been employed by a Reigning Family.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine head, whatever,&rdquo; he added, 
meditatively.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28b.jpg">
<img alt="Ross weighing the beast&rsquo;s head" 
src="images/p28s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Prince Ricardo now came beneath the library window, and gave 
his parents a brief account of his adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked the monster up early in the morning,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;through the magic telescope, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What country was he in?&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>&ldquo;The country people whom I met called it 
Ethiopia.&nbsp; They were niggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in what part of the globe is Ethiopia, 
Ricardo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Asia, perhaps,&rdquo; 
answered the prince.</p>
<p>The king groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy will <i>never</i> understand our foreign 
relations.&nbsp; Ethiopia in Asia!&rdquo; he said to himself, but
he did not choose to make any remark at the moment.</p>
<p>The prince ran upstairs to dress.&nbsp; On the stairs he met 
the Princess Jaqueline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick! are you hurt?&rdquo; she said, turning very 
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not I; but the monster is.&nbsp; I had a capital 
day, Jack; rescued a princess, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she&mdash;was she very pretty, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Pretty enough, I 
daresay.&nbsp; Much like other girls.&nbsp; Why, you look <!-- 
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>quite white!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Now 
you look all right again;&rdquo; for, indeed, the Princess 
Jaqueline was blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must dress.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ever so late,&rdquo; he 
said, hurrying upstairs; and the princess, with a little sigh, 
went down to the royal drawing-room.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p30.jpg">
<img alt="The King and the Prince" src="images/p30.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>When dinner was over and the ladies had left the room, the 
king tried to speak <i>seriously</i> to Prince Ricardo.&nbsp; 
This was a thing which he disliked doing very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little use in preaching,&rdquo; his 
Majesty used to say, &ldquo;to a man, or rather a boy, of another
generation.&nbsp; My taste was for books; I only took to 
adventures because I was obliged to do it.&nbsp; Dick&rsquo;s 
taste is for adventures; I only <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>wish some 
accident would make him take to books.&nbsp; But everyone must 
get his experience for himself; and when he has got it, he is 
lucky if it is not too late.&nbsp; I wish I could see him in love
with some nice girl, who would keep him at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king did not expect much from talking seriously to 
Dick.&nbsp; However, he began by asking questions about the 
day&rsquo;s sport, which Ricardo answered with modesty.&nbsp; 
Then his Majesty observed that, from all he had ever read or 
heard, he believed Ethiopia, where the fight was, to be in 
Africa, not in Asia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really wish, Ricardo, that you would attend to your 
geography a little more.&nbsp; It is most necessary to a soldier 
that he should know where his enemy is, and if he has to fight 
the Dutch, for instance, not to start with his army for Central 
Asia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could always spot them through the magic <!-- page 
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>glass, father,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;it saves such a 
lot of trouble.&nbsp; I hate geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the glass might be lost or broken, or the Fairies 
might take it away, and then where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> would know where to go, or Mr. 
Belsham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Belsham was his tutor, from Oxford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall not always be here, and when I 
die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of dying, sire,&rdquo; said 
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you are not so very old; you may live for
years yet.&nbsp; Besides, I can&rsquo;t stand the notion.&nbsp; 
You must live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sentiment is unusual in a Crown Prince,&rdquo; 
thought the king; but he was pleased for all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to oblige you, I&rsquo;ll try to struggle against
old age,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but there are always 
accidents.&nbsp; Now, Dick, like a good fellow, <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and to please
me, work hard all to-morrow till the afternoon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
come in and help you.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s always a splendid 
evening rise of trout in the lake just now, so you can have your 
play after your work.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll enjoy it more, and I 
daresay you are tired after a long day with the big game.&nbsp; 
It used to tire me, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> rather tired,&rdquo; said Dick; and indeed 
he looked a little pale, for a day in the inside of a gigantic 
sea-monster is fatiguing, from the heat and want of fresh air 
which are usually found in such places.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think 
I&rsquo;ll turn in; goodnight, my dear old governor,&rdquo; he 
said, in an affectionate manner, though he was not usually given 
to many words.</p>
<p>Then he went and kissed his mother and the Princess Jaqueline,
whom he engaged to row him on the lake next evening, while he 
fished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you go muffing them with the 
landing-net, Jack, as you generally do,&rdquo; said <!-- page

Royal Highness, as he lit his bedroom candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would not call me Jack,&rdquo; said the 
princess to the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than Lina, my dear,&rdquo; said her 
Majesty, who in late life had become fond of her little joke; 
&ldquo;that always sounds as if someone else was 
fatter,&mdash;and I hope there is not someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess was silent, and fixed her eyes on her book.</p>
<p>Presently the king came in, and played a game with Lina at 
picquet.&nbsp; When they were all going to bed, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come into the study, Lina.&nbsp; I want you to 
write a few letters for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess followed him and took her seat at the writing 
table.&nbsp; The letters were very short.&nbsp; One was to Herr 
Schnipp, tailor to the king and royal family; another was to the 
royal <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>swordmaker, another to the bootmaker,
another to the optician, another to the tradesman who supplied 
the august family with carpets and rugs, another to his 
Majesty&rsquo;s hatter.&nbsp; They were all summoned to be at the
palace early next morning.&nbsp; Then his Majesty yawned, 
apologised, and went to bed.&nbsp; The princess also went to her 
room, or bower as it was then called, but not to sleep.</p>
<p>She was unhappy that Dick did not satisfy his father, and that
he was so careless, and also about other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why does the king want all these tailors and 
hatters so suddenly, telescope-makers and swordmakers and 
shoemakers, too?&rdquo; she asked herself, as she stood at the 
window watching the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>could</i> find out.&nbsp; I could turn myself into
a dog or a cat, and go into the room where he is giving his 
orders.&nbsp; But that is awkward, for <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>when the 
servants see Rip&rdquo; (that was the dog) &ldquo;in two places 
at once, they begin to think the palace is haunted, and it makes 
people talk.&nbsp; Besides, I know it is wrong to listen to what 
one is not meant to hear.&nbsp; It is often difficult to be a 
magician and a good girl.&nbsp; The temptations are so strong, 
stronger than most people allow for.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she 
remained, with the moon shining on her pretty yellow hair and her
white dress, wondering what the king intended to do, and whether 
it was something that Dick would not like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me,&rdquo; she said at length, 
&ldquo;after all the lessons I have had.&nbsp; Why, I can 
<i>drink the moon</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, this is a way of knowing what anyone else is thinking of 
and intends to do, for the moon sees and knows everything.&nbsp; 
Whether it is <i>quite fair</i> is another matter; but, at all 
events, it is not <i>listening</i>.&nbsp; And anyone may see 
that, if <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>you are a magician, like the Princess
Jaqueline, a great many difficult questions as to what is right 
and wrong at once occur which do not trouble other people.&nbsp; 
King Prigio&rsquo;s secret, why he sent for the tailor and the 
other people, was his own secret.&nbsp; The princess decided that
she would not find it out by turning herself into Rip or the cat 
(whose name was Semiramis), and, so far, she was quite 
right.&nbsp; But she was very young, and it never occurred to her
that it was just as wrong to find out what the king meant by 
<i>drinking the moon</i> as by listening in disguise.&nbsp; As 
she grew older she learned to know better; but this is just the 
danger of teaching young girls magic, and for that very reason it
has been given up in most countries.</p>
<p>However, the princess did not think about right and wrong, 
unluckily.&nbsp; She went to the bookcase and took down her 
<i>Cornelius Agrippa</i>, in one great tall black volume, with 
silver clasps <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>which nobody else could open; for, as
the princess said, there are books which it would never do to 
leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read 
them.&nbsp; Nobody could undo the clasps, however strong or 
clever he might be; but the princess just breathed on them and 
made a sign, and the book flew open at the right place&mdash;Book
IV., chapter vi., about the middle of page 576.</p>
<p>The magic spell was in Latin, of course; but the princess knew
Latin very well, and soon she had the magic song by heart.&nbsp; 
Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf.&nbsp; Then
she threw open the window and drew back the curtains, and put out
all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a 
white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame, opposite the
window.&nbsp; And into that mirror the moon shone white and full,
filling all the space of it, so that the room was <!-- page 
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>steeped in a strange silver light.&nbsp; Now the whole 
room seemed to sway gently, waving and trembling; and as it 
trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music, as if it 
were filled with the waves of the sea.</p>
<p>Then the princess took a great silver basin, covered with 
strange black signs and figures raised in the silver.&nbsp; She 
poured water into the basin, and as she poured it she sang the 
magic spell from the Latin book.&nbsp; It was something like 
this, in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh Lady Moon, on the waters riding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On shining waters, in silver sheen,<br />
Show me the secret the heart is hiding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Show me the truth of the thought, oh Queen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh waters white, where the moon is riding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That knows what shall be and what has been,<br />
Tell me the secret the heart is hiding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash me the truth of it, clear and clean!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled, 
and then fell still again; and the <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>princess 
knelt in the middle of the room, and the moon and the white light
from the mirror of the moon fell in the water.</p>
<p>Then the princess raised the basin, and stooped her mouth to 
it and drank the water, spilling a few drops, and so she <i>drank
the moon</i> and the knowledge of the moon.&nbsp; Then the moon 
was darkened without a cloud, and there was darkness in the sky 
for a time, and all the dogs in the world began to howl.&nbsp; 
When the moon shone again, the princess rose and put out the two 
white lights, and drew the curtains; and presently she went to 
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I know all about it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is clever; everything the king does is clever, and he 
is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm.&nbsp; But it
seems a cruel trick to play on poor Ricardo.&nbsp; However, 
Jaqueline is on the watch, and I&rsquo;ll show them a girl can do
more than people think,&rdquo;&mdash;as, indeed, she could.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>After meditating in this way, the princess fell sleep, 
and did not waken till her maid came to call her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! your Royal Highness, what&rsquo;s this on the 
floor?&rdquo; said the faithful Rosina, as she was arranging the 
princess&rsquo;s things for her to get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; asked the princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever so many&mdash;four, five, six, seven&mdash;little 
shining drops of silver lying on the carpet, as if they had 
melted and fallen there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have not hurt the carpet?&rdquo; said the 
princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear! the queen won&rsquo;t be pleased 
at all.&nbsp; It was a little chemical experiment I was trying 
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops 
of the enchanted water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Royal Highness, the carpet is not 
harmed,&rdquo; said Rosina; &ldquo;only your Royal Highness 
should do these things in the laboratory.&nbsp; Her Majesty has 
often spoke about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said the princess; 
&ldquo;but as there is no harm done, we&rsquo;ll say nothing 
about it this time.&nbsp; And, Rosina, you may keep the silver 
drops for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness is always very kind,&rdquo; said 
Rosina, which was true; but how much better and wiser it is not 
to <i>begin</i> to deceive!&nbsp; We never know how far we may be
carried, and so Jaqueline found out.</p>
<p>For when she went down to breakfast, there was the king in a 
great state of excitement, for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>most</i> extraordinary,&rdquo; said his 
Majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you notice it?&nbsp; No, you had gone
to bed before it happened.&nbsp; But I was taking a walk in the 
moonlight, on the balcony, and I observed it 
carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observed what, my dear?&rdquo; asked the queen, who was
pouring out the tea.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see it, Dick?&nbsp; Late as 
usual, you young dog!&rdquo; the king remarked as Ricardo entered
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what, sir?&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you were asleep hours before, now I think of 
it!&nbsp; But it was <i>the</i> most extraordinary thing, an 
unpredicted eclipse of the moon!&nbsp; You must have noticed it, 
Jaqueline; you sat up later.&nbsp; How the dogs 
howled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I mean yes,&rdquo; murmured poor Jaqueline, who of 
course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts, but who had
forgotten, in the excitement of the moment, that an eclipse of 
the moon, especially if entirely unexpected, is likely to attract
very general attention.&nbsp; Jaqueline could not bear to tell a 
fib, especially to a king who had been so kind to her; besides, 
fibbing would not alter the facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did see it,&rdquo; she admitted, blushing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had it not been predicted?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>&ldquo;Not a word about it whispered anywhere,&rdquo; 
said his Majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I looked up the almanack at 
once.&nbsp; It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw, and 
I&rsquo;ve seen a good many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The astronomers must be duffers,&rdquo; said Prince 
Ricardo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought there was much in physical 
science of any sort; most dreary stuff.&nbsp; Why, they say the 
earth goes round the sun, whereas any fool can see it is just the
other way on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth
of his son and heir, the hope of Pantouflia.&nbsp; But what was 
the king to say in reply?&nbsp; The astronomers of Pantouflia, 
who conceived that they knew a great deal, had certainly been 
taken by surprise this time.&nbsp; Indeed, they have not yet 
satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon, though they 
have written volumes about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it may be the sun next!&rdquo; exclaimed <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>his 
Majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything may happen.&nbsp; The very laws of
gravitation themselves may go askew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the butler, William, who had been in the 
queen&rsquo;s family when she was a girl, entered, and 
announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the royal tradesmen, by appointment, to see 
your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the king, who had scarcely eaten any breakfast, much to the
annoyance of the queen, who was not agitated by eclipses, went 
out and joined the tailors and the rest of them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Dick went on with his breakfast.&nbsp; He ate cold pastry, and
poached eggs, and ham, and rolls, and raspberry jam, and hot 
cakes; and he drank two cups of coffee.&nbsp; Meanwhile the king 
had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders.&nbsp; They 
were all met in the royal study, where the king made them a most 
splendid bow, and requested them to be seated.&nbsp; But they 
declined to sit in his sacred presence, and <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the king 
observed that, in that case he must stand up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have invited you here, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;on a matter of merely private importance, but I must 
request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your
duties.&nbsp; It is difficult, I know, not to talk about 
one&rsquo;s work, but in this instance I am sure you will oblige 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty has only to command,&rdquo; said Herr 
Schnipp.&nbsp; &ldquo;There have been monarchs, in neighbouring 
kingdoms, who would have cut off all our heads after we had done 
a bit of secret business; but the merest word of your Majesty is 
law to your loving subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other merchants murmured assent, for King Prigio was 
really liked by his people.&nbsp; He was always good-tempered and
polite.&nbsp; He never went to war with anybody.&nbsp; He spent 
most of the royal income on public objects, and of course there 
were scarcely any taxes to speak of.&nbsp; <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Moreover, he 
had abolished what is called compulsory education, or making 
everybody go to school whether he likes it or not; a most 
mischievous and tyrannical measure!&nbsp; &ldquo;A fellow who 
can&rsquo;t teach himself to read,&rdquo; said the king, 
&ldquo;is not worth teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and because they were so fond of the 
queen, his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King 
Prigio.</p>
<p>Only one tradesman, bowing very deep and blushing very much, 
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, will you hear me for one 
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For an hour, with pleasure, Herr Schmidt,&rdquo; said 
the monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to 
decline an order; and if your Majesty asked for my heart&rsquo;s 
blood, I am ready to shed it, not to speak of anything in the 
line of my business&mdash;namely, boot and shoe making.&nbsp; But
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>keep a secret from my wife, I fairly own to your Majesty
that I can <i>not</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr Schmidt went down on his knees and wept.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p52b.jpg">
<img alt="Herr Schmidt went down on his knees" 
src="images/p52s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise, Herr Schmidt,&rdquo; said the king, taking him by
the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;A more honourable and chivalrous 
confession of an amiable weakness, if it is to be called a 
weakness, I never heard.&nbsp; Sir, you have been true to your 
honour and your prince, in face of what few men can bear, the 
chance of ridicule.&nbsp; There is no one here, I hope, but 
respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt&rsquo;s 
confession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from 
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live King Prigio the Good!&rdquo; they exclaimed, 
and vowed that everything should be kept dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sire,&rdquo; said the swordmaker, &ldquo;all 
the rest of us are bachelors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>&ldquo;That is none the worse for my purpose 
gentlemen,&rdquo; said his Majesty; &ldquo;but I trust that you 
will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed 
to such fathers.&nbsp; And now, if Herr Schmidt will kindly find 
his way to the buttery, where refreshments are ready, I shall 
have the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your 
labours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the king, with another magnificent bow, led the
way upstairs to a little turret-room, in a deserted part of the 
palace.&nbsp; Bidding the tradesmen enter, he showed them a large
collection of miscellaneous things: an old cap or two, a pair of 
boots of a sort long out of fashion, an old broadsword, a shabby 
old Persian rug, an ivory spy-glass, and other articles.&nbsp; 
These were, in fact, the fairy presents, which had been given to 
the king at his christening, and by aid of which (and his natural
acuteness) he had, <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in his youth, succeeded in many 
remarkable adventures.</p>
<p>The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness.&nbsp; 
The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the
air wherever he wished to go.&nbsp; The sword was the Sword of 
Sharpness.&nbsp; The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to 
see, however far off.&nbsp; The boots were the Seven-league 
Boots, which Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 
1697.&nbsp; There were other valuable objects, but these were the
most useful and celebrated.&nbsp; Of course the king did not tell
the tradesmen what they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said his Majesty, &ldquo;you see
these old things.&nbsp; For reasons which I must ask you to 
excuse me for keeping to myself, I wish you to provide me with 
objects exactly and precisely similar to these, with all the look
of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>The tradesmen examined the objects, each choosing that 
in his own line of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the sword, sire,&rdquo; said the cutler, 
&ldquo;it is an Andrea Ferrara, a fine old blade.&nbsp; By a 
lucky accident, I happen to have one at home in a small 
collection of ancient weapons, exactly like it.&nbsp; This 
evening it shall be at your Majesty&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Herr Schnitzler, you will kindly write an 
order for it, as I wish no one of you to leave the palace, if you
can conveniently stay, till your business is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, your Majesty,&rdquo; says the 
cutler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the old rug,&rdquo; said the upholsterer, 
&ldquo;I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home, at 
your Majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can do like Herr Schnitzler,&rdquo; who was 
the cutler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the hatter, &ldquo;have two old caps
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>just like these, part of a bankrupt theatrical 
stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are most fortunate,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boots, now I come to think of it, are unimportant, 
at least for the present.&nbsp; Perhaps we can borrow a pair from
the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the glass,&rdquo; said the optician, &ldquo;if 
your Majesty will allow me to take it home with 
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I cannot part with it,&rdquo; said the 
king; &ldquo;but that, too, is unimportant, or not very 
pressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he called for a servant, to order luncheon for the 
shopkeepers, and paper for them to write their orders on.&nbsp; 
But no one was within hearing, and in that very old part of the 
palace there were no bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just pardon me for an instant, while I run 
downstairs,&rdquo; said his Majesty; &ldquo;and, it seems a 
strange thing to ask, but may I advise you <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>not to sit 
down on that carpet?&nbsp; I have a reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, he was afraid that someone might sit down on it, and 
wish he was somewhere else, and be carried away, as was the 
nature of the carpet.</p>
<p>King Prigio was not absent a minute, for he met William on the
stairs; but when he came back, there was not one single person in
the turret-room!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth are they?&rdquo; cried the king, rushing
through all the rooms in that part of the castle.&nbsp; He 
shouted for them, and looked everywhere; but there was not a 
trace of tailor, hatter, optician, swordmaker, upholsterer.</p>
<p>The king hastened to a window over the gate, and saw the 
sentinels on duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>And the sentinels turned round, looked up, and saluted.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&ldquo;Have you seen anyone go out?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, sire,&rdquo; answered the soldiers.</p>
<p>The king, who began to guess what had happened, hurried back 
to the turret-room.</p>
<p>There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their 
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means this, gentlemen?&rdquo; said his Majesty, 
severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what reason did you leave the room 
without my permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all knelt down, humbly imploring his compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, you donkeys!&rdquo; said the king, forgetting 
his politeness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get up, and tell me where you have 
been hiding yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hatter came forward, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, you will not believe me; indeed, I can scarcely 
believe it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor none of us can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the 
swordmaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been home, and brought the 
articles.&nbsp; All orders executed with punctuality <!-- page 
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and 
dispatch,&rdquo; he added, quoting his own advertisement without 
thinking of it.</p>
<p>On this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the Andrea 
Ferrara blade, which was exactly like the Sword of Sharpness.</p>
<p>The upholsterer undid his parcel, and there was a Persian rug,
which no one could tell from the magical carpet.</p>
<p>The hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel, when he
suddenly remembered, what the king in his astonishment had not 
noticed, that he had a cap on himself.&nbsp; He pulled it off in 
a hurry, and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap, 
and understood all about the affair.&nbsp; The hatter, in his 
absence, had tried on the Wishing Cap, and had wished that he 
himself and his friends were all at home and back again with 
their wares at the palace.&nbsp; And what he wished happened, of 
course, as was natural.&nbsp; In a moment the king saw how much 
talk <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>this business would produce in the country, and he 
decided on the best way to stop it.</p>
<p>Seizing the Wishing Cap, he put it on, wished all the 
tradesmen, including the shoemaker, back in the town at their 
shops, and also wished that none of them should remember anything
about the whole affair.</p>
<p>In a moment he was alone in the turret-room.&nbsp; As for the 
shopkeepers, they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed 
something odd; but, as it went no further, of course they did not
talk about it, and nobody was any the wiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owl that I am!&rdquo; said King Prigio to 
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might have better wished for a complete 
set of sham fairy things which would not work.&nbsp; It would 
have saved a great deal of trouble; but I am so much out of the 
habit of using the cap, that I never thought of it.&nbsp; 
However, what I have got will do very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, putting on the Cap of Darkness, that <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>nobody might 
see him, he carried all the <i>real</i> fairy articles away, 
except the Seven-league Boots, to his own room, where he locked 
them up, leaving in their place the sham Wishing Cap, the sham 
Cap of Darkness, the sham Sword of Sharpness, and the carpet 
which was not a magic carpet at all.</p>
<p>His idea was, of course, that Ricardo would start on an 
expedition confiding in his fairy things, and he would find that 
they did not act.&nbsp; Then he would be left to his own 
cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape.&nbsp; That 
would teach him, thought the king, to depend on himself, and to 
set a proper value on cleverness and learning, and minding his 
book.</p>
<p>Of course he might have locked the things up, and forbidden 
Ricardo to touch them, but that might have seemed harsh.&nbsp; 
And, as you may easily imagine, with all the powers at his <!-- 
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>command, the king fancied he could easily rescue Ricardo
from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians 
or monsters.&nbsp; He only wanted to give him a fright or two, 
and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than 
himself.</p>

<p>For several days Prince Ricardo minded his books, and, 
according to his tutors, made considerable progress in polite 
learning.&nbsp; Perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for
this, because, in fact, he saw no means of distinguishing himself
by adventures just at that time.&nbsp; Every morning he would 
climb the turret and sweep the horizon, and even <i>much</i> 
beyond the horizon, with the ivory spy-glass.&nbsp; But look as 
he would, he saw no monsters preying on <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>human-kind 
anywhere, nor princesses in distress.&nbsp; To be sure he saw 
plenty of poor people in distress, and, being a good-hearted, 
though careless, lad, Dick would occasionally fly off with the 
Purse of Fortunatus in his pocket, and give them as much money as
they needed&mdash;it cost him nothing.&nbsp; But this was not the
kind of adventure which he enjoyed.&nbsp; Dragons for his 
money!</p>
<p>One day the Princess Jaqueline took a curious plan of showing 
Ricardo how little interest, after all, there is in performing 
the most wonderful exploits without any real difficulty or 
danger.&nbsp; They were drifting before a light breeze on a hill 
lake; Ricardo was fishing, and Jaqueline was sculling a stroke 
now and then, just to keep the boat right with the wind.&nbsp; 
Ricardo had very bad sport, when suddenly the trout began to rise
all over the lake.&nbsp; Dick got excited, and stumbled about the
boat from stern <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to bow, tripping over 
Jaqueline&rsquo;s feet, and nearly upsetting the vessel in his 
hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p66b.jpg">
<img alt="Drifting in a light breeze" src="images/p66s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But, as too often occurs, they were taking one particular fly 
which was on the water, and would look at nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother them!&rdquo; cried Ricardo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
can&rsquo;t find a fly in my book in the least like that little 
black one they are feeding on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried half-a-dozen different fly-hooks, but all to no 
purpose; he lost his temper, got his tackle entangled in 
Jaqueline&rsquo;s hair and then in the landing-net; and, though 
such a big boy, he was nearly crying with vexation.</p>
<p>The Princess Jaqueline, with great pains and patience, 
disentangled the casting line, first from her hair, which Ricardo
was anxious to cut (the great stupid oaf,&mdash;her pretty hair!)
then from the landing-net; but Dick had grown sulky.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have 
not a fly that will suit.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; and 
he threw a tin can at a rising trout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dick,&rdquo; said Jaqueline, &ldquo;you know I can
help you.&nbsp; I did not learn magic for nothing.&nbsp; Just you
look the other way for a minute or two, and you will find the 
right fly at the end of your line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned his head away (it is not proper to look on at 
magical arts), and then in a moment, saw the right hook on his 
cast; but Jaqueline was not in the boat.&nbsp; She had turned 
herself into an artificial fly (a small black gnat), and Dick 
might set to his sport again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a trump that girl is,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Clever, too!&rdquo; and he began casting.&nbsp; He got a 
trout every cast, great big ones, over a pound, and soon he had a
basketful.&nbsp; But he began to feel rather bored.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much fun taking them,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;when they are so silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that very moment he noticed that the fly was off his cast, 
and Jaqueline was sitting at the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Ricardo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was right 
after all.&nbsp; There is not much pleasure in sport that is easy
and certain.&nbsp; Now, apply this moral to dragon-killing with 
magic instruments.&nbsp; It may be useful when one is obliged to 
defend oneself, but surely a prince ought not to give his whole 
time to nothing else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had no answer ready, so he only grumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always preaching at me, Jack; everybody 
always is.&nbsp; I seem to have been born just to be preached 
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people are; and it does grow rather tedious in the long 
run.&nbsp; But perhaps what <!-- page 71--><a 
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Jaqueline 
said may have made some impression on Ricardo, for he stuck to 
his books for weeks, and was got into decimal fractions and 
Euclid.</p>
<p>All this, of course, pleased the king very much, and he began 
to entertain hopes of Ricardo&rsquo;s becoming a wise and learned
prince, and a credit to his illustrious family.</p>
<p>Things were not always to go smoothly, far from it; and it was
poor Jaqueline who fell into trouble next.&nbsp; She had been 
very ready to lecture Dick, as we saw, and took a good deal of 
credit to herself for his steadiness.&nbsp; But one day King 
Prigio happened to meet Jaqueline&rsquo;s maid, Rosina, on the 
stairs; and as Rosina was a pretty girl, and the king was always 
kind to his dependents, he stopped to have a chat with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rosina, what a pretty little silver cross you are 
wearing,&rdquo; he said, and he lifted a <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>curious 
ornament which hung from a chain on Rosina&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; It
consisted of seven drops of silver, set like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p72.jpg">
<img alt="The drops" src="images/p72.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo; his Majesty asked, and 
Rosina, all in a flutter, took it off and gave if to him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very curious
and pretty!&nbsp; May I ask you where you got this, 
Rosina?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p73b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said the king.  &ldquo;Very 
curious and pretty!&rdquo;" src="images/p73s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Now Rosina generally had her answer ready, and I am very sorry
to say that she did not always speak the truth when she could 
think of anything better.&nbsp; On this occasion she was anxious 
to think of something better, for fear of getting Jaqueline into 
a scrape about the chemical experiment in her bedroom.&nbsp; But 
Rosina was fluttered, as we said, by the royal <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>kindness, and
she could think of nothing but to curtsy, and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, your Majesty, the princess gave me the 
drops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There is a little white moon shining in each of 
them!&nbsp; I wonder if they shine in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door of a cupboard which had no windows, where 
the housemaid kept her mops and brooms, and shut himself 
in.&nbsp; Yes, there was no mistake; the darkness was quite 
lighted up with the sheen of the seven little moons in the 
silver.&nbsp; The king looked rather grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can trust me with this cross till to-morrow, 
Rosina, I should like to have it examined and analysed.&nbsp; 
This is no common silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Rosina could only curtsy, but she was very much 
alarmed about the consequences to her mistress.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>After luncheon, the king asked Jaqueline to come into 
his study, as he often did, to help him with his letters.&nbsp; 
When they had sat down his Majesty said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jaqueline, I never interfere with your 
pursuits, but I almost doubt whether <i>Cornelius Agrippa</i> is 
a good book for a very young lady to read.&nbsp; The Fairy 
Paribanou, I am sure, taught you nothing beyond the ordinary 
magical accomplishments suited to your rank; but there are a 
great many things in the <i>Cornelius</i> which I think you 
should not study till you are older and wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your Majesty mean?&rdquo; said poor 
Jaqueline, feeling very uncomfortable; for the king had never 
lectured her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said his Majesty, taking the silver cross 
out of his pocket, &ldquo;did you not give this to 
Rosina?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>&ldquo;Yes, sire, I did give her the drops.&nbsp; She 
had them made up herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then give it back to her when you see her next.&nbsp; I
am glad you are frank, Jaqueline.&nbsp; And you know, of course, 
that the drops are not ordinary silver?&nbsp; They are moon 
silver, and that can only be got in one way, so far as I know, at
least&mdash;when one spills the water when he, or she, is 
drinking the moon.&nbsp; Now, there is only one book which tells 
how that can be done, and there is only one reason for doing it; 
namely, to find out what is some other person&rsquo;s 
secret.&nbsp; I shall not ask you <i>whose</i> secret you wanted 
to find out, but I must request you never to do such a thing 
again without consulting me.&nbsp; You can have no reason for it,
such as a great king might have whose enemies are plotting 
against his country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sire, I will tell you everything!&rdquo; cried 
Jaqueline.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t; I don&rsquo;t want to 
know.&nbsp; I am sure you will make no use of your information 
which you think I should not approve of.&nbsp; But there is 
another thing&mdash;that eclipse of the moon!&nbsp; Oh, 
Jaqueline, was it honourable, or fair to the astronomers and men 
of science, to say nothing about it?&nbsp; Their European 
reputations are seriously injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jaqueline could only cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said his Majesty, comforting 
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no great harm done yet, and perhaps 
they would not believe you if you did explain; but just think, if
some people ceased to believe in Science, what would they have 
left to believe in?&nbsp; But you are young, of course, and 
cannot be expected to think of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought about it at all,&rdquo; wept 
Jaqueline.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Evil is wrought by want of 
thought,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the king, quoting the poet.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Now run away, dry your tears, and I think you had better 
bring me that book, and I&rsquo;ll put it back in one of the 
locked-up shelves.&nbsp; Later, when you are older, we shall see 
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess flew to her room, and returned with her 
book.&nbsp; And the king kissed her, and told her to go and see 
if her Majesty meant to take a drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never deceive him again, never . . . unless 
it is <i>quite</i> necessary,&rdquo; said the princess to 
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, it is not so easy to deceive the 
king.&nbsp; What a lot he has read!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, King Prigio had been very studious when a young man, 
before he came to the throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; thought the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;No 
doubt she was trying her fortune, wondering if Ricardo cares for 
her a little.&nbsp; Of course <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>I could not 
let her tell me <i>that</i>, poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this guess, as we know, his Majesty was mistaken, which 
seldom happened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who she is?&rdquo; the king went on speaking 
to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;That great booby, Ricardo, saved her 
from wild birds, which were just going to eat her.&nbsp; She was 
fastened to a mountain top, but <i>where</i>? that&rsquo;s the 
question.&nbsp; Ricardo never has any notion of geography.&nbsp; 
It was across the sea, he noticed <i>that</i>; but which 
sea,&mdash;Atlantic, Pacific, the Black Sea, the Caspian, the Sea
of Marmora, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the German Ocean, the 
Mediterranean?&nbsp; Her ornaments were very peculiar; there was 
a broad gold sun on her breast.&nbsp; I must look at them again 
some day.&nbsp; She said she was being sacrificed to wild birds 
(which her people worshipped), because there was some famine, or 
war, or trouble in the <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>country.&nbsp; She said she was a 
Daughter of the Sun; but that, of course, is absurd, 
unless&mdash;By Jove!&nbsp; I believe I have it,&rdquo; said the 
king, and he went into the royal library and was looking for some
old Spanish book, when his secretary came and said that the 
Russian Ambassador was waiting for an interview with his 
Majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dismal old Muscovite!&rdquo; sighed the king.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;A monarch has not a moment to himself for his private 
studies.&nbsp; Ah, Prigio! why wert thou not born to a private 
station?&nbsp; But Duty before everything,&rdquo; and wreathing 
his royal countenance in smiles, his Majesty prepared to give 
Count Snoreonski an audience.</p>
<p>It was all about the attitude of Pantouflia in the event of a 
Polish invasion of Russia.&nbsp; The king reassured Count 
Snoreonski, affirming that Pantouflia, while deeply regretting 
the disturbed relations between two States in whose welfare <!-- 
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>she was deeply interested, would ever preserve an 
attitude of benevolent neutrality, unless her own interests were 
threatened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may give your message to my august mistress, the 
Czarina?&rdquo; said the ambassador.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, adding an expression of my tender 
interest in her Majesty&rsquo;s health and welfare,&rdquo; said 
the king, presenting the count at the same time with a 
magnificent diamond snuffbox containing his portrait.</p>
<p>The old count was affected to tears, and withdrew, while King 
Prigio said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not lost a day; I have made an amiable but very 
stupid man happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such are, or rather such were, the toils of monarchs!</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; said Prince Ricardo one morning, 
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a queer letter for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Prigio had gone to a distant part of his dominions, on 
business of importance, and the young people were sitting in the 
royal study.&nbsp; The letter, which Ricardo handed to Jaqueline,
was written on a great broad sheet of paper, folded up without 
any envelope, as <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>was the custom then, and was sealed 
with a huge seal in red wax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the arms,&rdquo; Ricardo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ricardo, how you <i>do</i> neglect your 
Heraldry!&nbsp; Old Green Stocking is in despair over your 
ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Green Stocking was the chief herald of Pantouflia, just 
like Blue Mantle in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, these are the Royal Arms of England, you great 
ignorant Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rome isn&rsquo;t in England, is it?&mdash;and the 
post-mark is &lsquo;Roma&rsquo;: that&rsquo;s Rome in some lingo,
I expect.&nbsp; It is in Latin, anyhow, I know.&nbsp; <i>Mortuus 
est Rom&aelig;</i>&mdash;&lsquo;He died at Rome.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s in the Latin Grammar.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see what the 
fellow says, anyhow,&rdquo; added Ricardo, breaking the seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He begins, &lsquo;Prins and dear Cousin!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
say, Jaqueline, he spells it &lsquo;Prins;&rsquo; now it is <span
class="smcap">P-r-i-n-c-e</span>.&nbsp; He <i>must</i> be an 
ignorant fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
85</span>&ldquo;People in glass houses should not throw stones, 
Dick,&rdquo; said Jaqueline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He signs himself &lsquo;Charles, P. W.,&rsquo;&rdquo; 
said Ricardo, looking at the end.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who on earth can 
he be?&nbsp; Why does he not put &lsquo;P. W. Charles,&rsquo; if 
these are his initials?&nbsp; Look here, it&rsquo;s rather a long
letter; you might read it to us, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess took the epistle and began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice it smells, all scented!&nbsp; The paper is 
gilt-edged, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luxurious beggar, whoever he is,&rdquo; said 
Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he says: &lsquo;Prins and dear Cousin,&mdash;You 
and me&rsquo; (oh, what grammar!) &lsquo;are much the same age, I
being fifteen next birthday, and we should be better 
<i>ackwainted</i>.&nbsp; All the wurld has herd of the fame of 
Prins Ricardo, whose name is <i>feerd</i>, and his <i>sord</i> 
dreded, wherever there are Monsters and Tirants.&nbsp; Prins, you
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
86</span>may be less well informed about my situation.&nbsp; I 
have not killed any Dragguns, there being nun of them here; but I
have been <i>under fiar</i>, at Gaeta.&rsquo;&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Gaeta, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of it,&rdquo; said Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is in Italy, and it was besieged lately.&nbsp;
He goes on: &lsquo;and I am told that I did not misbehave myself,
nor disgrace <i>the blud of Bruce</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of Robert Bruce,&rdquo; said Dick; 
&ldquo;he was the man who did not kill the spider, but he cracked
the head of Sir Harry Bohun with one whack of his axe.&nbsp; I 
remember <i>him</i> well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your correspondent seems to be a descendant of 
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s getting more interesting,&rdquo; said 
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish my father would go to war with 
somebody.&nbsp; With the Sword of Sharpness I&rsquo;d make the 
enemy whistle!&nbsp; Drive on, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a prins in distress, I apeal to your 
valler, so renouned in Europe.&nbsp; I am kept out of my own; my 
royal father, King Gems,&rsquo;&mdash;well, this is the worst 
spelling I ever saw in my life!&nbsp; He means King 
<i>James</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;my royal father, King Gems, being druv
into exile by a crewl Usurper, the Elector of Hannover.&nbsp; 
King Gems is <i>old</i>, and likes a quiat life; but I am 
determined to make an effort, if I go alone, and Europe shall

not?&mdash;of your royal Highness&rsquo;s courage and 
sordsmanship, I throw myself at your feet, and implore you to 
asist a prins in distres.&nbsp; Let our sords be drawn together 
in the caus of freedom and an outraged country, my own.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;&lsquo;I remain,<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Prins and dear Cuzen,<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Charles</span>, P. 
W.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. W. means Prince of Wales,&rdquo; added <!-- page 
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>Jaqueline.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is turned out of England you 
know, and lives at Rome with his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that chap,&rdquo; said Prince Ricardo.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He does not spell very well, as you say, but I sometimes 
make mistakes myself; and I like his spirit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
been looking out for an adventure; but the big game is getting 
shy, and my sword rusts in his scabbard.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell 
you what, Jack&mdash;I&rsquo;ve an idea!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put him
on the throne of his fathers; it&rsquo;s as easy as shelling 
peas: and as for that other fellow, the Elector, I&rsquo;ll send 
him back to Hanover, wherever that may be, and he can go on 
electing, and polling his vote in peace and quietness, at 
home.&nbsp; Just wait till I spot the places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince ran up to the turret, fetched the magic spy-glass, 
and looked up London, Rome, and Hanover, as you would in a 
map.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>&ldquo;Well, Dick, but how do you mean to do 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it?&mdash;nothing simpler!&nbsp; I just take my 
Seven-league Boots, run over to Rome, pick up Prince Charles, put
him on the magic carpet, fly to London, clap the Cap of Darkness 
on him so that nobody can see him, set him down on the throne of 
his fathers; pick up the Elector, carry him over to his beloved 
Hanover, and the trick is done&mdash;what they call a bloodless 
revolution in the history books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the English don&rsquo;t like Prince Charles when
they get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like him? they&rsquo;re sure to like him, a young 
fellow like that!&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;ll take the sword with 
me in case of accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dick, it is your father&rsquo;s rule that you are 
never to meddle in the affairs of other countries, and never to 
start on an expedition when he is not at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t mind this time!&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s no kind of danger; and I&rsquo;m sure he will 
approve of the <i>principle</i> of the thing.&nbsp; Kings must 
stick up for each other.&nbsp; Why, some electing characters 
might come here and kick <i>us</i> out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is not the sort of king who is kicked 
out,&rdquo; said Jaqueline.</p>
<p>But there was no use in talking to Dick.&nbsp; He made his 
simple preparations, and announced that he would be back in time 
for luncheon.</p>
<p>What was poor Jaqueline to do?&nbsp; She was extremely 
anxious.&nbsp; She knew, as we saw, what King Prigio had intended
about changing the fairy things for others that would not 
work.&nbsp; She was certain Dick would get himself into a scrape;
how was she to help him?&nbsp; She made up her mind quickly, 
while Dick was putting his things together.&nbsp; She <!-- page 
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>told 
the queen (it was the nearest to the truth she could think of) 
that she &ldquo;was going for a turn with Dick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
she changed herself into a mosquito&mdash;a kind of gnat that 
bites&mdash;and hid herself under a fold of Dick&rsquo;s 
coat.&nbsp; Of course he knew nothing about her being 
there.&nbsp; Then he started off in his Seven-league Boots, and 
before you could say &ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo; he was in Rome, 
in the grounds of a splendid palace called the Villa 
Borghese.</p>
<p>There he saw an elderly gentleman, in a great curled wig, 
sound asleep on a seat beneath a tree.&nbsp; The old gentleman 
had a long, pale, melancholy face, and across his breast was a 
broad blue ribbon with a star.&nbsp; Ah! how changed was King 
James from the handsome Prince who had loved fair Beatrix Esmond,
thirty years ago!&nbsp; Near him were two boys, not quite so old 
as Prince Ricardo.&nbsp; The younger was a pretty dark boy, with 
a <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>funny little roundabout white wig.&nbsp; He was 
splendidly dressed in a light-blue silk coat; a delicate little 
lace scarf was tied round his neck; he had lace ruffles falling 
about his little ringed hands; he had a pretty sword, with a gold
handle set with diamonds&mdash;in fact, he was the picture of a 
little dandy.&nbsp; The other lad had a broad Scotch bonnet on, 
and no wig; beautiful silky yellow locks fell about his 
shoulders.&nbsp; He had laid his sword on the grass.&nbsp; He was
dressed in tartan, which Ricardo had never seen before; and he 
wore a kilt, which was also new to Ricardo, who wondered at his 
bare legs&mdash;for he was wearing shoes with no stockings.&nbsp;
In his hand he held a curious club, with a long, slim handle, and
a head made heavy with lead, and defended with horn.&nbsp; With 
this he was aiming at a little white ball; and suddenly he swung 
up the club and sent the ball out of sight in the air, over 
several trees.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>Prince Ricardo stepped up to this boy, took off his cap,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have the honour of addressing the Prince of 
Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Charles started at the sight of a gentleman in long 
riding-boots, girt with a broadsword, which was not then 
generally worn, and carrying a Persian rug under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I am called, sir,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;by those who give me the title which is mine by 
right.&nbsp; May I inquire the reason which offers me the 
pleasure of this unexpected interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m Ricardo of Pantouflia!&rdquo; says 
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a letter from you this morning, and I 
believe you wanted to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Pantouflia, sir,&rdquo; said Prince Charles; 
&ldquo;why, that is hundreds of leagues away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good distance,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;but a 
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>mere step when you wear Seven-league Boots like 
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear prince,&rdquo; said Charles, throwing himself 
into his arms with rapture, and kissing him in the Italian 
fashion, which Dick did not half like, &ldquo;you are, indeed, 
worthy of your reputation; and these are the celebrated 
Seven-league Boots?&nbsp; Harry,&rdquo; he cried to his brother, 
&ldquo;come here at once and let me present you to his Royal 
Highness, our illustrious ally, Prince Ricardo of 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; The Duke of York&mdash;Prince Ricardo of 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; Gentlemen, know each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince bowed in the most stately manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Dick, who was seldom at all up to 
the standard of royal conversation, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that game
you were playing?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s new to me.&nbsp; You sent the 
ball a tremendous long shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game is called golf, and is the favourite <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>pastime of my loyal Scottish subjects,&rdquo; said 
Prince Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;For that reason, that I may be able 
to share the amusements of my people, whom I soon hope to lead to
a glorious victory, followed by a peaceful and prosperous reign, 
I am acquiring a difficult art.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m practising 
walking without stockings, too, to harden my feet,&rdquo; he 
said, in a more familiar tone of voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fancy 
there are plenty of long marches before me, and I would not be a 
spear&rsquo;s length behind the hardiest Highlander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&nbsp; I respect you,&rdquo; said Dick, with 
the greatest sincerity; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think, with me 
on your side, you will need to make many marches.&nbsp; It will 
all be plain sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray explain your plan,&rdquo; said Prince 
Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;The task of conquering back the throne of 
my fathers is not so simple as you seem to suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a good many difficult 
things,&rdquo; said Dick, modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conqueror of the magician, Gorgonzola, and the 
Giant Who never Knew when he had Enough, need not tell me 
that,&rdquo; said Prince Charles, with a courteous allusion to 
two of Ricardo&rsquo;s most prodigious adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve very little to be proud of, 
really,&rdquo; said Dick, blushing; &ldquo;anyone could do as 
much with my fairy things, of which, no doubt, you have 
heard.&nbsp; With a Sword of Sharpness and a Cap of Darkness, and
so forth, you have a great pull over almost anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really possess those talismans?&rdquo; said the
prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do.&nbsp; You see how short a time I took 
in coming to your call from Pantouflia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has Holy Church,&rdquo; asked the Duke of York, 
with anxiety, &ldquo;given her sanction and <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>her blessing 
to those instruments of an art, usually, in her wisdom, 
forbidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind Holy Church, Harry!&rdquo; said Prince 
Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is <i>business</i>.&nbsp; Besides, the
English are Protestants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray for their conversion daily,&rdquo; said the Duke
of York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end justifies the means, you know,&rdquo; answered 
Prince Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair in love and 
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Ricardo, 
&ldquo;especially against those brutes of Electors; they give 
trouble at home sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, too, are plagued with an Elector?&rdquo; asked 
Prince Charles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An</i> Elector? thousands of them!&rdquo; answered 
Dick, who never could understand anything about politics.</p>
<p>Prince Charles looked puzzled, but requested Dick to explain 
his great plan.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>They sat down on the grass, and Ricardo showed them how 
he meant to manage it, just as he had told Jaqueline.&nbsp; As he
said, nothing could be simpler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start at once,&rdquo; he said, and, 
inducing Prince Charles to sit down on the magic carpet, he 
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;England!&nbsp; St. James&rsquo;s Palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nothing happened!</p>
<p>The carpet was not the right magic carpet, but the one which 
King Prigio had put in its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on!&nbsp; England, I said!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>But there they remained, under the chestnut tree, sitting on 
the carpet above the flowery grass.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p99b.jpg">
<img alt="But there they remained" src="images/p99s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Prince Charles leaped to his feet; his face like fire, his 
eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of this fooling, sir!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is easy, but cowardly, to mock at an unfortunate 
prince.&nbsp; Take your carpet and be off with you, <!-- page 
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>out of the gardens, or your shoulders shall taste my 
club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been some mistake,&rdquo; Ricardo said; 
&ldquo;the wrong carpet has been brought by accident, or the 
carpet has lost its power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this sacred city, blessed by the presence of his 
Holiness the Pope, and the relics of so many martyrs and saints, 
magic may well cease to be potent,&rdquo; said the Duke of 
York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; You are an impostor, sir!&nbsp; Leave 
my presence!&rdquo; cried Prince Charles, lifting his 
golf-club.</p>
<p>Dick caught it out of his hand, and broke across his knee as 
fine a driver as ever came from Robertson&rsquo;s shop at St. 
Andrew&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs, 
sir!&nbsp; Draw and defend yourself!&rdquo; he said, kicking off 
his boots and standing in his socks on the grass.</p>
<p>Think of the horror of poor Jaqueline, who <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>witnessed 
this terrible scene of passion from a fold in Prince 
Ricardo&rsquo;s dress!&nbsp; What could the girl do to save the 
life of two princes, the hopes of one nation, and of a 
respectable minority in another?</p>
<p>In a moment Prince Charles&rsquo;s rapier was shining in the 
sunlight, and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude, his 
left hand gracefully raised and curved.</p>
<p>Dick drew his sword, but, as suddenly, threw it down 
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hit 
you with <i>this</i>!&nbsp; This is the Sword of Sharpness; it 
would cut through your steel and your neck at a touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me beseech your Royal Highness,&rdquo; he said to 
the Duke of York, who was in a terrible taking, &ldquo;to lend 
your blade to a hand not less royal than your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;Give him it, Hal!&rdquo; said Prince Charles, 
who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground, and 
the blade bent.&nbsp; &ldquo;He seems to believe in his own 
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke yielded his sword; Dick took it, made a nourish, and 
rushed at Prince Charles.</p>
<p>Now Ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the good of it,&rdquo; he used to ask, 
&ldquo;all that stamping, and posture-making, and ha-haing?&nbsp;
The Sword of Sharpness is enough for <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now he could not, in honour, use the Sword of Sharpness; 
so on he came, waving the rapier like a claymore, and made a 
slice at Prince Charles&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The prince, very much surprised, parried in prime, riposted, 
and touched Dick on the hand.</p>
<p>At this moment the Princess Jaqueline did what she should have
thought of sooner.&nbsp; She flew out of Dick&rsquo;s coat, and 
stung old King <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>James on his royal nose.&nbsp; The 
king wakened, nearly crushed the princess (so dangerous is the 
practice of magic to the artist), and then leaped up, and saw 
Dick&rsquo;s blade flying through the air, glittering in the 
sun.&nbsp; The prince had disarmed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! what&rsquo;s all this?&nbsp; <i>&Agrave; 
moi</i>, <i>mes gardes</i>!&rdquo; cried the old king, in French 
and English; and then he ran up, just in time to hear Prince 
Charles say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, take your life!&nbsp; I cannot strike an unarmed 
man.&nbsp; A prince you may be, but you have not learned the 
exercises of gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this, Carluccio?&rdquo; asked the old 
king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Swords out! brawling in my very presence! 
blood drawn!&rdquo; for Dick&rsquo;s hand was bleeding a good 
deal.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, as briefly as possible, explained the unusual 
nature of the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A king must hear both sides,&rdquo; said King <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>James.&nbsp; &ldquo;What reply have you, sir, to make 
to his Royal Highness&rsquo;s statements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carpet would not work, sir,&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It never happened before.&nbsp; Had I used my own 
sword,&rdquo; and he explained its properties, &ldquo;the Prince 
of Wales would not be alive to tell his story.&nbsp; I can say no
more, beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I 
could not have foreseen.&nbsp; A gentleman can only say that he 
is sorry.&nbsp; But wait!&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I can at least 
prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not 
misplaced.&nbsp; Bid me bring you 
something&mdash;anything&mdash;from the ends of the earth, and it
shall be in your hands.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say 
fairer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King James reflected, while Prince Ricardo was pulling on the 
Seven-league Boots, which he had kicked off to fight more freely,
and while the Duke of York bandaged Dick&rsquo;s hand with a 
kerchief.</p>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;Bring me,&rdquo; said his Majesty, &ldquo;Lord 
Lovat&rsquo;s snuff-mull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Gortuleg, in Scotland,&rdquo; answered King 
James.</p>
<p>Dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken, and
in ten minutes was back, bearing a large ram&rsquo;s-horn 
snuff-box, with a big cairngorm set in the top, and the Frazer 
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most astonishing!&rdquo; said King James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle!&rdquo; said the Duke of York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have entirely cleared your character,&rdquo; said 
the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your honour is without a stain, though it 
is a pity about the carpet.&nbsp; Your nobility in not using your
magical sword, under the greatest provocation, reconciles me to 
this fresh blighting of my hopes.&nbsp; All my allies fail 
me,&rdquo; said the poor king with a sigh; &ldquo;you alone have 
failed with honour.&nbsp; Carluccio, embrace the 
prince!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>They fell into each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;you have taught me a 
lesson for which I shall not be ungrateful.&nbsp; With any blade 
a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight.&nbsp; I
shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With any blade,&rdquo; said Prince Charles, &ldquo;I 
shall be happy to find Prince Ricardo by my side in a stricken 
field.&nbsp; We shall not part till I have induced you to accept 
a sword which I can never hope to draw against another adversary 
so noble.&nbsp; In war, my weapon is the claymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the prince offered to Ricardo the ruby-studded hilt of 
his rapier, which had a beautiful white shark-skin sheath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must accept it, sir,&rdquo; said King James; 
&ldquo;the hilt holds the rubies of John Sobieski.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, prince,&rdquo; said Ricardo, &ldquo;for the 
weapon, which I shall learn to wield; and <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>I entreat 
you to honour me by receiving this fairy gift&mdash;which 
<i>you</i> do not need&mdash;a ring which makes all men faithful 
to the wearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales bowed, and placed the talisman on his 
finger.</p>
<p>Ricardo then, after a few words of courtesy on both parts, 
picked up his useless carpet, took his farewell of the royal 
party, and, with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar, 
returned at full speed, but with a heavy heart, to Pantouflia, 
where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon.</p>
<p>Ricardo never interfered in foreign affairs again, but his 
ring proved very useful to Prince Charles, as you may have read 
in history.</p>
<h2><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span

Ricardo&rsquo;s Repentance.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Bottle of weapon salve" src="images/p109s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The queen, as it happened fortunately, was lunching with one 
of the ladies of her Court.&nbsp; Ricardo did not come down to 
luncheon, and Jaqueline ate hers alone; and very mournful she 
felt.&nbsp; The prince had certainly not come well out of the 
adventure.&nbsp; He had failed (as all attempts to restore the 
Stuarts <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>always did); he had been wounded, 
though he had never received a scratch in any of his earlier 
exploits; and if his honour was safe, and his good intentions 
fully understood, that was chiefly due to Jaqueline, and to the 
generosity of King James and Prince Charles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; she said to 
herself, and at last she went up and knocked at Ricardo&rsquo;s 
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to 
see anybody.&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me&mdash;Jaqueline.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p111b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me&rdquo;" 
src="images/p111s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away!&nbsp; I want nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me in, dear Dick; I have good news for 
you,&rdquo; said the princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Ricardo, unlocking the 
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you bother a fellow so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been crying&mdash;his hand obviously hurt him badly; he
looked, and indeed he was, very sulky.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;How did you get on in England, Dick?&rdquo; 
asked the princess, taking no notice of his bandaged hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; said Ricardo.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been to England at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that is horrid happened,&rdquo; said Dick; 
and then, unable to keep it any longer to himself, he said: 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve failed to keep my promise; I&rsquo;ve been 
insulted, I&rsquo;ve been beaten by a fellow younger than myself;
and, oh! how my hand does hurt, and I&rsquo;ve got such a 
headache!&nbsp; And what am I to say to my mother when she asks 
why my arm is in a sling? and what will my father say?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m quite broken down and desperate.&nbsp; I think 
I&rsquo;ll run away to sea;&rdquo; and indeed he looked very wild
and miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how it all happened, Dick,&rdquo; said the 
princess; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not so <!-- page 
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
114</span>bad as you make out.&nbsp; Perhaps I can help 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can a girl help a man?&rdquo; cried Dick, angrily; 
and poor Jaqueline, remembering how she <i>had</i> helped him, at
the risk of her own life, when King James nearly crushed her in 
the shape of a mosquito, turned her head away, and cried 
silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a beast,&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg
your pardon, Jack dear.&nbsp; You are always a trump, I will say;
but I don&rsquo;t see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told her all the story (which, of course, she knew 
perfectly well already), except the part played by the mosquito, 
of which he could not be aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure it was not so bad as you made it out, 
Dick,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, the old king, who is
not very wise, but is a perfectly honourable gentleman, gave you 
the highest praise.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thought of lecturing him a 
little about <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>disobeying his father, but it did 
not seem a good opportunity.&nbsp; Besides, Jaqueline had been 
lectured herself lately, and had not enjoyed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to say to my mother?&rdquo; Dick 
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must think of something to say,&rdquo; said 
Jaqueline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell my mother anything but the 
truth,&rdquo; Ricardo went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my hand,
how it does sting! and she must find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can cure it,&rdquo; said Jaqueline.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say Prince Charles gave you his own 
sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there it is; but what has that to do with 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in the world to do with it, my dear 
Dick.&nbsp; How lucky it is that he gave it to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she ran to her own room, and brought <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>a beautiful
golden casket, which contained her medicines.</p>
<p>Taking out a small phial, marked (in letters of emerald):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Weapon 
Salve</span>,&rdquo;</p>
<p>the princess drew the bright sword, extracted a little of the 
ointment from the phial, and spread it on a soft silk 
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with the sword?&rdquo; asked 
Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polish it a little,&rdquo; said Jaqueline, smiling, and
she began gently to rub, with the salve, the point of the 
rapier.</p>
<p>As she did so, Ricardo&rsquo;s arm ceased to hurt, and the 
look of pain passed from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I feel quite better!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I can use my hand as well as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he took off the stained handkerchief, and, lo, there was 
not even a mark where the wound had been!&nbsp; For this was the 
famous <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Weapon Salve which you may read 
about in Sir Kenelm Digby, and which the Lady of Branxholme used,
in <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>.&nbsp; But the secret of 
making it has long been lost, except in Pantouflia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the best girl in the world, Jaqueline,&rdquo; 
said Ricardo.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may give me a kiss if you like; 
and I won&rsquo;t call you &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; or laugh at you 
for reading books, any more.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something in 
books after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess did not take advantage of Dick&rsquo;s 
permission, but advised him to lie down and try to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, though,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what about my 
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king need never be told anything about it,&rdquo; 
said Jaqueline, &ldquo;need he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that won&rsquo;t do!&nbsp; I tell my father 
everything; but then, I never had anything like this to tell him 
before.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think, Jaqueline, <!-- page 
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>you might break it to him?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very fond 
of you.&nbsp; Just tell him what I told you; it&rsquo;s every 
word of it true, and he ought to know.&nbsp; He might see 
something about it in the <i>Mercure de France</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the newspaper of the period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will get into the papers,&rdquo;
said Jaqueline, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody could tell, except 
the king and the princes, and they have reasons for keeping it to
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust that younger one,&rdquo; said Dick,
moodily; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that young man.&nbsp; 
Anyway, my father <i>must</i> be told; and, if you won&rsquo;t, I
must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; said Jaqueline.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now lie down till evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner, in the conservatory, Jaqueline told King Prigio 
all about it.</p>
<p>His Majesty was very much moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What extraordinary bad luck that family <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>has!&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had not 
changed the rug, the merest accident, Prince Charles would have 
dined at St. James&rsquo;s to-night, and King George in 
Hanover.&nbsp; It was the very nearest thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This meddling with practical affairs will never 
do,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick has had a lesson, sire,&rdquo; said the 
princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;ll never mix himself up 
with politics again, whatever happens.&nbsp; And he says he means
to study all about them, for he feels frightfully ignorant, and, 
above all, he means to practise his fencing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks were not part of the conversation between 
Ricardo and Jaqueline, but she considered that Dick <i>meant</i> 
all this, and, really, he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well, as far as it goes,&rdquo; said the 
king.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Jaqueline, about that mosquito?&rdquo; 
for she had told him this part of the adventure.&nbsp; <!-- page 
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>&ldquo;That was a very convenient mosquito, though I 
don&rsquo;t know how Dick was able to observe it from any 
distance.&nbsp; I see <i>your</i> hand in that, my dear, and I am
glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the 
good Fairy Paribanou.&nbsp; Jaqueline,&rdquo; he added solemnly, 
laying his hand on her head, &ldquo;You have saved the honour of 
Pantouflia, which is dearer to me than life.&nbsp; Without your 
help, I tremble to think what might have occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess blushed very much, and felt very happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now run away to the queen, my dear,&rdquo; said his 
Majesty, &ldquo;I want to think things over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did think them over, and the more he thought the more he 
felt the inconvenience attending the possession of fairy 
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An eclipse one day, as nearly as possible a revolution 
soon after!&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But for 
Jaqueline, Ricardo&rsquo;s conduct would have <!-- page 121--><a 
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>been blazed
abroad, England would have been irritated.&nbsp; It is true she 
cannot get at Pantouflia very easily; we have no sea-coast, and 
we are surrounded by friendly countries.&nbsp; But it would have 
been a ticklish and discreditable position.&nbsp; I must really 
speak to Dick,&rdquo; which he did next morning after 
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have broken my rules, Ricardo,&rdquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;True, there is no great harm done, and you 
have confessed frankly; but how am I to trust you any 
longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my sacred word of honour, father, 
that I&rsquo;ll never meddle with politics again, or start on an 
expedition, without telling you.&nbsp; I have had enough of 
it.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll turn over a new leaf.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
learned to be ashamed of my ignorance; and I&rsquo;ve sent for 
Francalanza, and I&rsquo;ll fence every day, and read like 
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe
you <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>mean what you say.&nbsp; Now go to 
your fencing lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I say, father,&rdquo; cried Ricardo, &ldquo;was it
not strange about the magic carpet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you not to trust to these things,&rdquo; said 
the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some enchanter may have deprived it of its
power, it may be worn out, someone may have substituted a common 
Persian rug; anything may happen.&nbsp; You <i>must</i> learn to 
depend on yourself.&nbsp; Now, be off with you, I&rsquo;m 
busy.&nbsp; And remember, you don&rsquo;t stir without my 
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince ran off, and presently the sounds of stamping feet 
and &ldquo;<i>un</i>, <i>deux</i>; <i>doublez</i>, 
<i>d&eacute;gagez</i>, <i>vite</i>; <i>contre de 
carte</i>,&rdquo; and so forth, might be heard over a great part 
of the royal establishment.</p>

with,&rdquo; said Ricardo, at breakfast one morning, his mouth 
full of sardine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Ricardo, your language is most 
unprincely,&rdquo; said his august father; &ldquo;I am always 
noticing it.&nbsp; You mean, I suppose, that <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>there is 
one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish.&nbsp; What 
is the name of the doomed foe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is the greatest villain in history,&rdquo; 
said Ricardo.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have read about him, sir, the
Yellow Dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have certainly studied what is told us about 
him,&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is no favourite of 
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the only one, if you notice, sir, of all the 
scoundrels about whom our ancestors inform us, who escaped the 
doom which he richly merited at the sword of a good 
knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may here remark that, since Dick took to his studies, he 
could speak, when he chose, like a printed book, which was by no 
means the case before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you remember, sir, he polished off&mdash;I mean, he 
slew&mdash;the King of the Golden Mines and the beautiful, though
frivolous, Princess <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Frutilla.&nbsp; All that the 
friendly Mermaid could do for them was to turn them into a pair 
of beautiful trees which intertwine their branches.&nbsp; Not 
much use in <i>that</i>, sir!&nbsp; And nothing was done to the 
scoundrel.&nbsp; He may be going on still; and, with your leave, 
I&rsquo;ll go and try a sword-thrust with him.&nbsp; Francalanza 
says I&rsquo;m improving uncommon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take the usual Sword of Sharpness,&rdquo; 
said his Majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir, to a dwarf?&nbsp; Not I, indeed: a common 
small sword is good enough to settle <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he is very cunning of fence,&rdquo; said the 
king; &ldquo;and besides, I have heard something of a diamond 
sword that he stole from the King of the Golden Mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely he has lost it or sold it, the shabby 
little miscreant; however, I&rsquo;ll risk it.&nbsp; And now I 
must make my preparations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>The king did not ask what they were; as a rule, they 
were simple.&nbsp; But, being in the shop of the optician that 
day, standing with his back to the door, he heard Dick come in 
and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles, with which he was 
at once provided.&nbsp; The people of Pantouflia were accustomed 
to wear them, saying that they improved the complexions of ladies
whom they met, and added cheerfulness to things in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain rose-coloured glass, Herr Spex,&rdquo; said 
Dick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not short-sighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy is beginning to show some sense,&rdquo; said 
the king to himself, knowing the nature and the difficulties of 
the expedition.</p>
<p>Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a 
Dandie Dinmont terrier, named Pepper, and the king, who 
understood the motive of this precaution, silently approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad has come to some purpose and <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>forethought,&rdquo; the king said, and he gladly 
advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles&rsquo;
eggs, which can rarely be got quite fresh.&nbsp; When Jaqueline 
had made the crocodiles&rsquo; eggs, with millet-seed and 
sugar-candy, into a cake for the Dwarf&rsquo;s lions, Ricardo 
announced that his preparations were complete.</p>
<p>Not to be the mere slave of custom, he made this expedition on
horseback, and the only magical thing he took with him was the 
Cap of Darkness (the one which would not work, but he did not 
know that), and this he put in his pocket for future use.&nbsp; 
With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches, and cold 
minced-collop sandwiches, he <i>pricked forth</i> into the 
wilderness, making for the country inhabited by the Yellow 
Dwarf.&nbsp; The princess was glad he was riding, for she 
privately accompanied him in the disguise of <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>a wasp; and
a wasp, of course, could not have kept up with him in his 
Seven-league Boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang that wops!&rdquo; said Prince Ricardo several 
times, buffeting it with his pocket-handkerchief when it buzzed 
in his ear and round his horse&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p129b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;Hang that wops!&rdquo; said Prince Ricardo" 
src="images/p129s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, King Prigio had taken his precautions, which were 
perfectly simple.&nbsp; When he thought Ricardo was getting near 
the place, the king put on his Wishing Cap, sat down before the 
magic crystal ball, and kept his eye on the proceedings, being 
ready to wish the right thing to help Ricardo at the right 
moment.&nbsp; He left the window wide open, smoked his cigar, and
seemed the pattern of a good and wise father watching the conduct
of a promising son.</p>
<p>The prince rode and rode, sometimes taking up Pepper on his 
saddle; passing through forests, sleeping at lonely inns, fording
rivers, till one day he saw that the air was becoming <!-- page 
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>Yellow.&nbsp; He knew that this showed the 
neighbourhood of Jaunia, or Daunia, the country of the Yellow 
Dwarf.&nbsp; He therefore drew bridle, placed his rose-coloured 
spectacles on his nose and put spurs to his horse, for the yellow
light of Jaunia makes people melancholy and cowardly.&nbsp; As he
pricked on, his horse stumbled and nearly came on its nose.&nbsp;
The prince noticed that a steel chain had been drawn across the 
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What caitiff has dared!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when his 
hat was knocked off by a well-aimed orange from a neighbouring 
orange-tree, and a vulgar voice squeaked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Blinkers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the Yellow Dwarf, an odious little figure, sitting 
sucking an orange in the tree, swinging his wooden shoes, and 
grinning all over his wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young Blinkers!&rdquo; said the Dwarf, <!-- page 
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>&ldquo;what are you doing on my grounds?&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;re a prince, by your look.&nbsp; Yah! down with 
kings!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a man of the people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dwarf of the worst description, 
that&rsquo;s what <i>you</i> are,&rdquo; said Ricardo; &ldquo;and
let me catch you, and I&rsquo;ll flog the life out of you with my
riding-whip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very face of the Dwarf, even seen through rose-coloured 
spectacles, made him nearly ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you can catch me,&rdquo; said the Dwarf; 
&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not to-day, nor yet to-morrow.&nbsp; What
are you doing here?&nbsp; Are you an ambassador, maybe come to 
propose a match for me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not proud, I&rsquo;ll 
hear you.&nbsp; They say there&rsquo;s a rather well-looking 
wench in your parts, the Princess Jaqueline&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mention that lady&rsquo;s name, you villain,&rdquo; 
cried Dick, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll cut down your 
orange-tree!&rdquo; and he wished he had brought the Sword of 
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>Sharpness, for you cannot prod down a tree with the 
point of a rapier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy her yourself?&rdquo; said the Dwarf, showing his 
yellow teeth with a detestable grin; while Ricardo turned quite 
white with anger, and not knowing how to deal with this 
insufferable little monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a widower, I am,&rdquo; said the Dwarf, 
&ldquo;though I&rsquo;m out of mourning,&rdquo; for he wore a 
dirty clay-coloured Yellow jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;My illustrious 
consort, the Princess Frutilla, did not behave very nice, and I 
had to avenge my honour; in fact, I&rsquo;m open to any offers, 
however humble.&nbsp; Going at an alarming sacrifice!&nbsp; Come 
to my box&rdquo; (and he pointed to a filthy clay cottage, all 
surrounded by thistles, nettles, and black boggy water), 
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll talk over your proposals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your impudent tongue!&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The Princess Frutilla was an <!-- page 134--><a 
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>injured 
saint; and as for the lady whom I shall not name in your 
polluting presence, I am her knight, and I defy you to deadly 
combat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may imagine how glad the princess was when (disguised as a 
wasp) she heard Dick say he was her knight; not that, in fact, he
had thought of it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re for a fight, are you?&rdquo; sneered 
the Dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might tell you to hit one of your own 
weight, but I&rsquo;m not afraid of six of you.&nbsp; Yah! 
mammy&rsquo;s brat!&nbsp; Look here, young Blinkers, I 
don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&nbsp; Just turn old Dobbin&rsquo;s 
head, and trot back to your mammy, Queen Rosalind, at 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; Does she know you&rsquo;re out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be into <i>you</i>, pretty quick,&rdquo; 
said Ricardo.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why do I bandy words with a 
miserable peasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t get much the best of them <!-- page 
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
135</span>either,&rdquo; said the Dwarf, provokingly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll fight, if you will have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince leaped from his horse, leaving Pepper on the 
saddle-bow.</p>
<p>No sooner had he touched the ground than the Dwarf 
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! to him, Billy! to him, Daniel! at him, good lions, 
at him!&rdquo; and, with an awful roar, two lions rushed from a 
neighbouring potato-patch and made for Ricardo.&nbsp; These were 
not ordinary lions, history avers, each having two heads, each 
being eight feet high, with four rows of teeth; their skins as 
hard as nails, and bright red, like morocco. <a 
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135" 
class="citation">[135]</a></p>
<p>The prince did not lose his presence of mind; hastily he threw
the cake of crocodiles&rsquo; eggs, millet-seed, and sugar-candy 
to the lions.&nbsp; This is a dainty which lions can never 
resist, and running greedily at it, with four tremendous <!-- 
page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
136</span>snaps, they got hold of each other by their jaws, and 
their eight rows of teeth were locked fast in a grim and deadly 
<i>struggle for existence</i>!</p>
<p>The Dwarf took in the affair at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed be he who taught you this!&rdquo; he cried, and 
then whistled in a shrill and vulgar manner on his very dirty 
fingers.&nbsp; At his call rushed up an enormous Spanish cat, 
ready saddled and bridled, and darting fire from its eyes.&nbsp; 
To leap on its back, while Ricardo sprang on his own steed, was 
to the active Dwarf the work of a moment.&nbsp; Then clapping 
spurs to its sides (his spurs grew naturally on his bare heels, 
horrible to relate, like a cock&rsquo;s spurs) and taking his cat
by the head, the Dwarf forced it to leap on to Ricardo&rsquo;s 
saddle.&nbsp; The diamond sword which slew the king of the Golden
Mines&mdash;that invincible sword which hews iron like a 
reed&mdash;was up and flashing in the air!</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>At this very moment King Prigio, seeing, in the magic 
globe, all that passed, and despairing of Ricardo&rsquo;s life, 
was just about to wish the dwarf at Jericho, when through the 
open window, with a tremendous whirr, came a huge vulture, and 
knocked the king&rsquo;s wishing cap off!&nbsp; Wishing was now 
of no use.</p>
<p>This odious fowl was the Fairy of the Desert, the 
Dwarf&rsquo;s trusted ally in every sort of mischief.&nbsp; The 
vulture flew instantly out of the window; and ah! with what awful
anxiety the king again turned his eyes on the crystal ball only a
parent&rsquo;s heart can know.&nbsp; Should he see Ricardo 
bleeding at the feet of the abominable dwarf?&nbsp; The king 
scarcely dared to look; never before had he known the nature of 
fear.&nbsp; However, look he did, and saw the dwarf un-catted, 
and Pepper, the gallant Dandie Dinmont, with his teeth in the 
throat of the monstrous Spanish cat.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>No sooner had he seen the cat leap on his 
master&rsquo;s saddle-bow than Pepper, true to the instinct of 
his race, sprang at its neck, just behind the head&mdash;the 
usual place,&mdash;and, with an awful and despairing mew, the cat
(Peter was its name) gave up its life.</p>
<p>The dwarf was on his feet in a moment, waving the diamond 
sword, which lighted up the whole scene, and yelling 
taunts.&nbsp; Pepper was flying at his heels, and, with great 
agility, was keeping out of the way of the invincible blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; screamed the Dwarf as Pepper got him by the 
ankle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call off your dog, you coward, and come down 
off your horse, and fight fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, <i>bleeding yellow blood</i>, dusty, mad with 
pain, the dwarf was a sight to strike terror into the 
boldest.</p>
<p>Dick sprang from his saddle, but so terrific was the 
appearance of his adversary, and so <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>dazzling 
was the sheen of the diamond sword, that he put his hand in his 
pocket, drew out, as he supposed, the sham Cap of Darkness, and 
placed it on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah! who&rsquo;s your hatter?&rdquo; screamed the 
infuriated dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i> see you!&rdquo; and he 
disengaged, feinted in carte, and made a lunge in seconde at Dick
which no mortal blade could have parried.&nbsp; The prince 
(thanks to his excellent training) just succeeded in stepping 
aside, but the dwarf recovered with astonishing quickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward, <i>l&acirc;che</i>, poltroon, runaway!&rdquo; 
he hissed through his clenched teeth, and was about to make a 
thrust in tierce which must infallibly have been fatal, when the 
Princess Jaqueline, in her shape as a wasp, stung him fiercely on
the wrist.</p>
<p>With an oath so awful that we dare not set it down, the dwarf 
dropped the diamond sword, <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>sucked his 
injured limb, and began hopping about with pain.</p>
<p>In a moment Prince Ricardo&rsquo;s foot was on the blade of 
the diamond sword, which he passed thrice through the body of the
Yellow Dwarf.&nbsp; Squirming fearfully, the little monster 
expired, his last look a defiance, his latest word an insult:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&nbsp; Gig-lamps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Ricardo wiped the diamond blade clean from its yellow 
stains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p141b.jpg">
<img alt="The fight with the Yellow Dwarf" src="images/p141s.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Princess Frutilla is avenged!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; 
Then pensively looking at his fallen foe, &ldquo;Peace to his 
ashes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he died in harness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning at the word, he observed that the two lions were stiff
and dead, locked in each other&rsquo;s gory jaws!</p>
<p>At that moment King Prigio, looking in the crystal ball, gave 
a great sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; he said, 
lighting <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>a fresh cigar, for he had allowed 
the other to go out in his excitement, &ldquo;but it was a 
fight!&nbsp; I am not satisfied,&rdquo; his Majesty went on 
reflecting, &ldquo;with this plan of changing the magical 
articles.&nbsp; The first time was of no great importance, and I 
could not know that the boy would start on an expedition without 
giving me warning.&nbsp; But, in to-day&rsquo;s affair he owes 
his safety entirely to himself and Pepper,&rdquo; for he had not 
seen the wasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Fairy of the Desert quite baffled
me: it was terrible.&nbsp; I shall restore the right fairy things
to-night.&nbsp; As to the Fairy of the Desert,&rdquo; he said, 
forgetting that his Wishing Cap was on, &ldquo;I wish she were 
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hollow groan and the sound of a heavy body falling 
interrupted the king.&nbsp; He looked all about the room, but saw
nothing.&nbsp; He was alone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have been in the room, invisible,&rdquo; <!-- 
page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
144</span>said the king; and, of course, she has died in that 
condition.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I must find her body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king groped about everywhere, like a blind man, and at 
last discovered the dead body of the wicked fairy lying on the 
sofa.&nbsp; He could not see it, of course, but he felt it with 
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very awkward,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I cannot ring for the servants and make them take her 
away.&nbsp; There is only one plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he wished she were in her family pyramid, in the Egyptian 
desert, and in a second the sofa was unoccupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very dangerous and revengeful enemy is now removed 
from Ricardo&rsquo;s path in life,&rdquo; said his Majesty, and 
went to dress for dinner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ricardo was riding gaily home.&nbsp; The yellow 
light of Jaunia had vanished, and pure blue sky broke overhead as
soon as the dauntless Dwarf had drawn his latest breath.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
145</span>The poor, trembling people of the country came out of 
their huts and accompanied Dick, cheering, and throwing roses 
which had been yellow roses, but blushed red as soon as the Dwarf
expired.&nbsp; They attended him to the frontiers of Pantouflia, 
singing his praises, which Ricardo had the new and inestimable 
pleasure of knowing to be deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was sharp work,&rdquo; he said to himself, 
&ldquo;but much more exciting and glorious than the usual 
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return Dick did not fail to mention the wasp, and again
the king felt how great was his debt to Jaqueline.&nbsp; But they
did not think it well to trouble the good queen with the dangers 
Dick had encountered.</p>

The Giant who does not know when he has had Enough. <a

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p146b.jpg">
<img alt="The enormous letter" src="images/p146s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>One morning the post brought a truly enormous letter for 
Dick.&nbsp; It was as broad as a table-cloth, and the address was
written in letters as long as a hoop-stick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I seem 
to know that hand,&rdquo; said Ricardo; &ldquo;but I thought the 
fingers which held the pen had long been cold in 
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened, with his sword, the enormous <!-- page 147--><a 
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>letter, 
which was couched in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Giant as does not know when he has had 
<i>enuf</i>, presents his compliments to Prince Ricardo; and I, 
having recovered from the effects of our little recent 
<i>rally</i>, will be happy to meet you in the old place for a 
return-match.&nbsp; I not being handy with the pen, the Giant 
hopes you will excuse mistakes and bad writing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dick simply gazed with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I thought an enemy was killed and done for, it 
was that Giant,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I made mere 
mince-collops of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he could not refuse a challenge, not to speak of his 
duty to rid the world of so greedy and odious a tyrant.&nbsp; 
Dick, therefore, took the usual things (which the king had 
secretly restored), but first he tried them&mdash;putting on the 
Cap of Darkness before the glass, in which he could not see 
himself.&nbsp; On second thoughts, <!-- page 148--><a 
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>he 
considered it unfair to take the cap.&nbsp; All the other 
articles were in working order.&nbsp; Jaqueline on this occasion 
followed him in the disguise of a crow, flying overhead.</p>
<p>On reaching the cavern&mdash;a huge tunnel in the 
rock&mdash;where the Giant lived, Ricardo blew a blast on the 
horn which hung outside, and in obedience to a written notice, 
knocked also with a mace provided by the Giant for that 
purpose.&nbsp; Presently he heard heavy footsteps sounding along 
the cavern, and the Giant came out.&nbsp; He was above the common
height for giants, and his whole face and body were seamed over 
with little red lines, crossing each other like tartan.&nbsp; 
These were marks of encounters, in which he had been cut to bits 
and come together again; for this was his peculiarity, which made
him so dangerous.&nbsp; If you cut off his head, he went on just 
as before, only without it; and so about everything else.&nbsp; 
By dint of <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>magic, he could put his head on 
again, just as if it had been his hat, if you gave him time 
enough.&nbsp; On the last occasion of their meeting, Ricardo had 
left him in a painfully scattered condition, and thought he was 
done for.&nbsp; But now, except that a bird had flown away with 
the little finger of his left hand and one of his ears, the Giant
was as comfortable as anyone could be in his situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; he said to Dick, touching his
forehead with his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glad to see you looking so 
well.&nbsp; No bad feeling, I hope, on either side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None on mine, certainly,&rdquo; said Ricardo, holding 
out his hand, which the Giant took and shook; &ldquo;but Duty is 
Duty, and giants must go.&nbsp; The modern world has no room for 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hearty,&rdquo; said the Giant; &ldquo;I 
like a fellow of your kind.&nbsp; Now, shall we toss for 
corners?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Dick, calling 
&ldquo;Heads&rdquo; and winning.&nbsp; He took the corner with 
the sun on his back and in the Giant&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; To it 
they went, the Giant aiming a blow with his club that would have 
felled an elephant.</p>
<p>Dick dodged, and cut off the Giant&rsquo;s feet at the 
ankles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First blood for the prince!&rdquo; said the Giant, 
coming up smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Half-minute time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He occupied the half-minute in placing the feet neatly beside 
each other, as if they had been a pair of boots.</p>
<p><i>Round II.</i>&mdash;The Giant sparring for wind, Ricardo 
cuts him in two at the waist.</p>
<p>The Giant folded his legs up neatly, like a pair of trousers, 
and laid them down on a rock.&nbsp; He had now some difficulty in
getting rapidly over the ground, and stood mainly on the 
defensive, and on his waist.</p>
<p><i>Round III.</i>&mdash;Dick bisects the Giant.&nbsp; Both 
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>sides now attack him on either hand, and the feet kick 
him severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kicking!&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense; all fair in war!&rdquo; said the Giant.</p>
<p>But do not let us pursue this sanguinary encounter in all its 
<i>horrible details</i>.</p>
<p>Let us also remember&mdash;otherwise the scene would be too 
painful for an elegant mind to contemplate with 
entertainment&mdash;that the Giant was in excellent training, and
thought no more of a few wounds than you do of a crack on the leg
from a cricket-ball.&nbsp; He well deserved the title given him 
by the Fancy, of &ldquo;The Giant who does not Know when he has 
had Enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The contest was over; Dick was resting on a rock.&nbsp; The 
lists were strewn with interesting but imperfect fragments of the
Giant, when a set of double teeth of enormous size flew up <!-- 
page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
152</span>out of the ground and caught Ricardo by the 
throat!&nbsp; In vain he strove to separate the teeth, when the 
crow, stooping from the heavens, became the Princess Jaqueline, 
and changed Dick into a wren&mdash;a tiny bird, so small that he 
easily flew out of the jaws of the Giant and winged his way to a 
tree, whence he watched the scene.</p>
<p>But the poor Princess Jaqueline!</p>
<p>To perform the feat of changing Dick into a bird she had, of 
course, according to all the laws of magic, to resume her own 
natural form!</p>
<p>There she stood, a beautiful, trembling maiden, her hands 
crossed on her bosom, entirely at the mercy of the Giant!</p>
<p>No sooner had Dick escaped than the monster began to 
<i>collect himself</i>; and before Jaqueline could muster 
strength to run away or summon to her aid the lessons of the 
Fairy Paribanou, <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the Giant who never Knew when he had
Enough was himself again.&nbsp; A boy might have climbed up a 
tree (for giants are no tree-climbers, any more than the grizzly 
bear), but Jaqueline could not climb.&nbsp; She merely stood, 
pale and trembling.&nbsp; She had saved Dick, but at an enormous 
sacrifice, for the sword and the Seven-league Boots were lying on
the trampled grass.&nbsp; He had not brought the Cap of Darkness,
and, in the shape of a wren, of course he could not carry away 
the other articles.&nbsp; Dick was rescued, that was all, and the
Princess Jaqueline had sacrificed herself to her love for 
him.</p>
<p>The Giant picked himself up and pulled himself together, as we
said, and then approached Jaqueline in a very civil way, for a 
person of his breeding, head in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce myself,&rdquo; he said, and mentioned 
his name and titles.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>what 
<i>you</i> are doing here, and how you came?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p154b.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;Let me introduce myself,&rdquo; he said" 
src="images/p154s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Poor Jaqueline threw herself at his feet, and murmured a short
and not very intelligible account of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said the Giant, 
replacing his head on his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;What to do with
you, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Please 
don&rsquo;t eat me</i>,&rsquo; did you say?&nbsp; Why, what do 
you take me for?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not in that line at all; low, 
<i>I</i> call it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jaqueline was somewhat comforted at these words, dropped out 
of the Giant&rsquo;s lips from a considerable height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they call you &lsquo;The Giant who does not Know 
when he has had Enough,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Jaqueline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And proud of the title: not enough of fighting.&nbsp; 
Of <i>punishment</i> I am a glutton, or so my friends are pleased
to say.&nbsp; A brace of oxen, a drove of sheep or two, are 
enough for me,&rdquo; <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the Giant went on complacently, but 
forgetting to mention that the sheep and the oxen were the 
property of other people.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where am I to put you till
your friends come and pay your ransom?&rdquo; the Giant asked 
again, and stared at Jaqueline in a perplexed way.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t take you home with me, that is out of the 
question.&nbsp; I have a little woman of my own, and she&rsquo;s 
not very fond of other ladies; especially, she would like to 
poison them that have good looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Jaqueline saw that the Giant, big as he was, courageous 
too, was afraid of his wife!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do; I&rsquo;ll hand
you over to a neighbour of mine, who is a bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bachelor giant; would that be quite proper?&rdquo; 
said Jaqueline, trying to humour him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a giant, bless you; he&rsquo;s a queer 
fellow, it is not easy to say what he is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s <!-- 
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
158</span>the Earthquaker, him as shakes the earth now and then, 
and brings the houses about people&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jaqueline fairly screamed at hearing this awful news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! be quiet, do!&rdquo; said the Giant.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bring out my little woman, and she is not 
easy to satisfy with explanations when she finds me conversing 
with a lady unbeknown to her.&nbsp; The Earthquaker won&rsquo;t 
do you any harm; it&rsquo;s only for safe keeping I&rsquo;ll put 
you with him.&nbsp; Why, he don&rsquo;t waken, not once in fifty 
years.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s quite the dormouse.&nbsp; Turns on his 
bed now and then, and things upstairs get upset, more or less; 
but, as a rule, a child could play with him.&nbsp; Come 
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, taking Jaqueline up on one hand, on which she sat as if 
on a chair, he crossed a few ranges of mountains in as many 
strides.&nbsp; In front was one tall blue hill, with a flattened 
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>peak, and as they drew near the princess felt a curious
kind of wind coming round her and round her.&nbsp; You have heard
of whirlpools in water; well, this was just like a whirlpool of 
air.&nbsp; Even the Giant himself could hardly keep his legs 
against it; then he tossed Jaqueline up, and the airy whirlpool 
seized her and carried her, as if on a tide of water, always 
round and round in narrowing circles, till she was sucked down 
into the hollow hill.&nbsp; Even as she went, she seemed to 
remember the hill, as if she had dreamed about it, and the shape 
and colour of the country.&nbsp; But presently she sank softly on
to a couch, in a beautifully-lighted rocky hall.&nbsp; All around
her the floor was of white and red marble, but on one side it 
seemed to end in black nothing.</p>
<p>Jaqueline, after a few moments, recovered her senses fully, 
and changing herself into an eagle, tried to fly up and 
out.&nbsp; But as soon as <!-- page 160--><a 
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>she was in 
the funnel, the whirlpool of air always sucking down and down, 
was too strong for her wings.&nbsp; She was a prisoner in this 
great gleaming hall, ending in black nothingness.&nbsp; So she 
resumed her usual form, and walking to the edge of the darkness, 
found that it was not empty air, but something black, soft, and 
strong&mdash;something living.&nbsp; It had no form or shape, or 
none that she could make out; but it pulsed with a heart.&nbsp; 
Jaqueline placed her foot on this curious thing, when a voice 
came, like thunder heard through a feather-bed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not near time to get up yet!&rdquo; and then there was 
a snore, and the great hall rocked like a ship at sea.</p>
<p>It was the Earthquaker!</p>
<p>The habits of this monstrous animal are very little known, as,
of course, he never comes above ground, or at least very seldom, 
when he makes tracks like a dry river-bed across country.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
161</span>We are certain that there <i>are</i> Earthquakers, 
otherwise how can we account for earthquakes?&nbsp; But how to 
tackle an Earthquaker, how to get at him, and what to do with him
when you have got at him, are questions which might puzzle even 
King Prigio.</p>
<p>It was not easy to have the better of an enchantress like 
Jaqueline and a prince like Ricardo.&nbsp; In no ordinary 
circumstances could they have been baffled and defeated; but now 
it must be admitted that they were in a very trying and alarming 
situation, especially the princess.&nbsp; The worst of it was, 
that as Jaqueline sat and thought and thought, she began to 
remember that she was back in her own country.&nbsp; The hills 
were those she used to see from her father&rsquo;s palace windows
when she was a child.&nbsp; And she remembered with horror that 
once a year her people used to send a beautiful girl to the 
Earthquaker, by way of keeping him <!-- page 162--><a 
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>quiet, as 
you shall hear presently.&nbsp; And now she heard light footsteps
and a sound of weeping, and lo! a great troop of pretty girls 
passed, sweeping in and out of the halls in a kind of procession,
and looking unhappy and lost.</p>
<p>Jaqueline ran to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I? who are you?&rdquo; she cried, in the 
language of her own country, which came back to her on a 
sudden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are nurses of the Earthquaker,&rdquo; they 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our duty is to sing him asleep, and every year
he must have a new song; and every year a new maiden must be sent
down from earth, with a new sleepy song she has learned from the 
priests of Manoa, the City of the Sun.&nbsp; Are you the new 
singer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m <i>not</i>,&rdquo; said Jaqueline.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the priests of Manoa; I don&rsquo;t 
know any new sleepy song.&nbsp; I only want to find the way 
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;There is no way, or we should have found 
it,&rdquo; said one of the maidens; &ldquo;and, if you are the 
wrong girl, by the day after to-morrow they must send the right 
one, otherwise the Earthquaker will waken, and shake the world, 
and destroy Manoa, the City of the Sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they 
all wept softly in the stillness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can we get 
anything to eat here?&rdquo; asked poor Jaqueline, at last.</p>
<p>She was beginning to be very hungry, and however alarmed she 
might be, she felt that dinner would not be unwelcome.&nbsp; The 
tallest of the maidens clapped her hands, and immediately a long 
table was spread by unseen sprites with meringues and cold 
chicken, and several sorts of delicious ices.</p>
<p>We shall desert Jaqueline, who was rather less alarmed when 
she found that she was not to be starved, at all events, and 
return to Prince Ricardo, whom we left fluttering about <!-- page
164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>as
a little golden-crested wren.&nbsp; He followed the Giant and 
Jaqueline into the whirlpool of air as far as he dared, and when 
he saw her vanish down the cone of the hill, he flew straight 
back to Pantouflia.</p>
<h2><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span

Prigio has an Idea.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p165.jpg">
<img alt="Ricardo and Semiramis" src="images/p165.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A weary and way-worn little bird was Prince Ricardo when he 
fluttered into the royal study window, in the palace of 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; The king was out at a council meeting; knowing 
that Ricardo had the right things, all in good order, he was not 
in the least anxious about him.&nbsp; The king was out, but 
Semiramis was in&mdash;Semiramis, the great grey cat, sitting on 
a big book on the top of the library steps.&nbsp; Now Semiramis 
was very fond <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>of birds, and no sooner did Ricardo 
enter and flutter on to a table than Semiramis gathered herself 
together and made one fell spring at him.&nbsp; She just caught 
his tail feather.&nbsp; In all his adventures the prince had 
never been in greater danger.&nbsp; He escaped, but no more, and 
went flying round the ceiling, looking for a safe place.&nbsp; 
Finally he perched on a chandelier that hung from the roof.&nbsp;
Here he was safe; and so weary was he, that he put his head under
his wing and fell fast asleep.&nbsp; He was awakened by the 
return of the king, who threw himself on a sofa and 
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that Prime Minister! his dulness is as heavy as 
lead; much heavier, in fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his Majesty lit a cigar and took up a volume; he 
certainly was a sad bookworm.</p>
<p>Dick now began to fly about the room, brushing the 
king&rsquo;s face and trying to attract his notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; said his Majesty.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>And Dick alighted, and nestled in his breast.</p>
<p>On seeing this, Semiramis began to growl, as cats do when they
are angry, and slowly approached his Majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out, Semiramis!&rdquo; said the king; and lifting 
her by the neck, he put her out of the room and shut the door, at
which she remained scratching and mewing.</p>
<p>Dick now crept out of the royal waistcoat, flew to the 
king&rsquo;s ear, twittered, pointed out of the window with one 
claw, and, lying down on his back, pretended to be dead.&nbsp; 
Then he got up again, twittered afresh, pointed to the Wishing 
Cap, and, finally, convinced the king that this was no common 
fowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enchanted prince or princess,&rdquo; said Prigio, 
&ldquo;such as I have often read of.&nbsp; Who can it be?&nbsp; 
Not Jaqueline; she could change herself back in a moment.&nbsp; 
By the way, where <i>is</i> Jaqueline?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>He rang the bell, and asked the servant to look for the
princess.</p>
<p>Semiramis tried to come in, but was caught and shut up 
downstairs.</p>
<p>After doing this, the man replied that her Royal Highness had 
not been in the palace all day.</p>
<p>The king rushed to the crystal ball, looked all the world 
over; but no princess!&nbsp; He became very nervous, and at that 
moment Dick lighted on the crystal ball, and put his claw on the 
very hill where Jaqueline had disappeared.&nbsp; Then he cocked 
his little eye at the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, she is somewhere in the unknown centre of South 
America,&rdquo; said his Majesty; &ldquo;somewhere behind Mount 
Roraima, where nobody has ever been.&nbsp; I must look into 
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he put on the Wishing Cap, and wished that the bird would
assume his natural shape if <!-- page 171--><a 
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>he was 
under enchantment, as there seemed too good reason to 
believe.</p>
<p>Instantly Dick stood before him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p170b.jpg">
<img alt="Instantly Dick stood before him" src="images/p170s.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ricardo!&rdquo; cried the king in horror; &ldquo;and in
this disguise!&nbsp; Where have you been?&nbsp; What have you 
done with Jaqueline?&nbsp; Where are the Seven-league 
Boots?&nbsp; Where is the Sword of Sharpness?&nbsp; Speak!&nbsp; 
Get up!&rdquo; for Dick was kneeling and weeping bitterly at the 
royal feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All lost!&rdquo; said Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor 
Jaqueline! she was the best girl, and the prettiest, and the 
kindest.&nbsp; And the Earthquaker&rsquo;s got her, and the 
Giant&rsquo;s got the other things,&rdquo; Dick ended, crying 
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, Ricardo,&rdquo; said his Majesty, very 
pale, but calm and determined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, take a glass of
port, and explain how all this happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick drank the wine, and then he told his miserable story.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;You may well sob!&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you use
the Cap of Darkness?&nbsp; Mere conceit!&nbsp; But there is no 
use in crying over spilt milk.&nbsp; The thing is, to rescue 
Jaqueline.&nbsp; And what are we to say to your 
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it all,&rdquo; said 
Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother will break her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see her at once,&rdquo; said the king, 
&ldquo;and break it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a terrible task; but the queen had such just 
confidence in her Prigio that she soon dried her tears, remarking
that Heaven would not desert Jaqueline, and that the king would 
find a way out of the trouble.</p>
<p>His Majesty retired to his study, put his head in his hands, 
and thought and thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is, of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to 
destroy the Earthquaker before he wakens; but how?&nbsp; What can
kill such a monster?&nbsp; Prodding him with the sword would only
stir <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>him up and make him more 
vicious.&nbsp; And I know of no other beast we can set against 
him, as I did with the Fire-beast and the Ice-beast, when I was 
young.&nbsp; Oh, for an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his mind, somehow, went back to the Council and the 
ponderous stupidity of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavier than lead,&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By George!&nbsp; I have a plan.&nbsp; If I could get to 
the place where they keep the Stupidity, I could carry away 
enough of it to flatten out the Earthquaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he remembered how, in an old Italian poem, he had read 
about all the strange lumber-room of odd things which is kept in 
the moon.&nbsp; That is the advantage of reading: <i>Knowledge is
Power</i>; and you mostly get knowledge that is really worth 
having out of good old books which people do not usually 
read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Stupidity is kept in stock, up in the <!-- page 
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>moon, and comes from there, falling naturally down on 
the earth in small quantities, I might obtain enough for my 
purpose,&rdquo; thought King Prigio.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;how 
to get to the moon?&nbsp; There are difficulties about 
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But difficulties only sharpened the ingenuity of this 
admirable king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other fellow had a Flying Horse,&rdquo; said 
he.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;the other fellow&rdquo; King Prigio meant an Italian
knight, Astolfo, who, in old times, visited the moon, and there 
found and brought back the common sense of his friend, Orlando, 
as you may read in the poem of Ariosto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; reasoned King Prigio, &ldquo;if there is a 
Flying Horse at all, he is in the stables of the King of 
Delhi.&nbsp; I must look into this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the magic spy-glass, the king surveyed the world from 
China to Peru, and, sure enough, there was the famous Flying 
Horse in the <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>king&rsquo;s stable at Delhi.&nbsp; 
Hastily the king thrust his feet into the Shoes of 
Swiftness&mdash;so hastily, indeed, that, as the poet says, he 
&ldquo;madly crammed a left-hand foot into a right-hand 
shoe.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this, many people think, is a sign of good
luck; so he put the shoes on the proper feet, and in a few 
minutes was in the presence of the Great Mogul.</p>
<p>The monarch received him with some surprise, but with stately 
kindness, and listened to Prigio while he explained what he 
wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only too happy to assist so adventurous a 
prince,&rdquo; remarked the Great Mogul.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is 
like old times!&nbsp; Every horse in my stable is at your 
service, but, as you say, only the Flying Horse is of any use to 
you in this expedition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clapped his hands, the Grand Vizier appeared, and the king 
gave orders to have the Flying Horse saddled at once.&nbsp; He 
then presented <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>King Prigio with a large diamond, 
and came down into the courtyard to see him mount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very fresh,&rdquo; said the groom who held 
the bridle; &ldquo;has not been out of the stable for three 
hundred years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prigio sprang into the saddle among the salaams of the dusky 
multitude, and all the ladies of the seraglio waved their scented
handkerchiefs out of the windows.</p>
<p>The king, as he had been instructed, turned a knob of gold in 
the saddle of the Flying Horse, then kissed his hand to the 
ladies, and, giving the steed his head, cried, in excellent 
Persian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the moon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up flew the horse with an easy action, and the king&rsquo;s 
head nearly swam with the swiftness of the flight.&nbsp; Soon the
earth below him was no bigger than a top, spinning on its own 
axis <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>(see Geography books for this), and,
as night fell, earth was only a great red moon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p178b.jpg">
<img alt="King Prigio on the Flying Horse" src="images/p178s.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>Through the dark rode King Prigio, into the silver dawn of the
moon.&nbsp; All now became clear and silvery; the coasts of the 
moon came into sight, with white seas breaking on them; and at 
last the king reached the silver walls, and the gate of 
opal.&nbsp; Before the gate stood two beautiful ladies.&nbsp; One
was fair, with yellow locks, the colour of the harvest 
moon.&nbsp; She had a crown of a golden snake and white 
water-lilies, and her dress now shone white, now red, now golden;
and in her hand was the golden pitcher that sheds the dew, and a 
golden wand.&nbsp; The other lady was as dark as night&mdash;dark
eyes, dark hair; her crown was of poppies.&nbsp; She held the 
ebony Wand of Sleep.&nbsp; Her dress was of the deepest blue, 
sown with stars.&nbsp; The king knew that they were the maidens 
of the bright and the dark side of the <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
180</span>moon&mdash;of the side you see, and of the side that no
one has ever seen, except King Prigio.&nbsp; He stopped the 
Flying Horse by turning the other knob in the saddle, alighted, 
and bowed very low to each of the ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daring mortal! what make you here?&rdquo; they 
asked.</p>
<p>And then the king told them about Jaqueline and the 
Earthquaker, and how he needed a great weight of Stupidity to 
flatten him out with.</p>
<p>The ladies heard him in silence, and then they said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow us,&rdquo; and they flew lightly beside the 
Flying Horse till they had crossed all the bright side of the 
moon, above the silver palaces and silver seas, and reached the 
summit of the Mountains of the Moon which separate the bright 
from the dark side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I may go no further,&rdquo; said the bright <!-- 
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
181</span>lady; &ldquo;and beyond, as you see, all is darkness 
and heavy sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she touched Prigio with her golden wand with twisted 
serpents, and he became luminous, light raying out from him; and 
the dark lady, too, shone like silver in the night: and on they 
flew, over black rocks and black rivers, till they reached a huge
mountain, like a mountain of coal, many thousand feet high, for 
its head was lost in the blackness of darkness.&nbsp; The dark 
Moon-Lady struck the rock with her ebony wand, and said, 
&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; and the cliffs opened like a door, and they 
were within the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the dark lady, &ldquo;is the 
storehouse of all the Stupidity; hence it descends in showers 
like Stardust on the earth whenever this mountain, which is a 
volcano, is in eruption.&nbsp; Only a little of the Stupidity 
reaches the earth, and that only in invisible dust; yet <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span>you know how weighty it is, even in that 
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, madam,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;no one 
knows it better than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make your choice of the best sort of Stupidity for
your purpose,&rdquo; said the dark lady.</p>
<p>And in the light which flowed from their bodies King Prigio 
looked round at the various kinds of Solid Stupidity.&nbsp; There
it all lay in masses&mdash;the Stupidity of bad Sermons, of 
ignorant reviewers, of bad poems, of bad speeches, of dreary 
novels, of foolish statesmen, of ignorant mobs, of fine ladies, 
of idle, naughty boys and girls; and the king examined them all, 
and all were very, very heavy.&nbsp; But when he came to the 
Stupidity of the Learned&mdash;of dull, blind writers on 
Shakspeare, and Homer, and the Bible&mdash;then King Prigio saw 
that he had found the sort he wanted, and that a very little of 
it would go a long way.&nbsp; He <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>never could
have got it on the saddle of the Flying Horse if the dark lady 
had not touched it with her ebony wand, and made it light to 
carry till it was wanted for his purpose.&nbsp; When he needed it
for use, he was to utter a certain spell, which she taught him, 
and then the lump would recover its natural weight.&nbsp; So he 
easily put a great block on his saddle-bow, and he and the dark 
lady flew back till they reached the crest of the Mountains of 
the Moon.&nbsp; There she touched him with her ebony wand, and 
the silver light which the bright lady had shed on him died from 
his face and his body, and he became like other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see your way?&rdquo; said the dark lady, pointing 
to the bright moon of earth, shining far off in the heavens.</p>
<p>Then he knelt down and thanked her, and she murmured strange 
words of blessing which he did not understand; but her face was 
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
184</span>grave and kind, and he thought of Queen Rosalind, his 
wife.</p>
<p>Then he jumped on the Flying Horse, galloped down and down, 
till he reached his palace gate; called for Ricardo, set him 
behind him on the saddle, and away they rode, above land and wide
seas, till they saw the crest of the hollow hill, where Jaqueline
was with the Earthquaker.&nbsp; Beyond it they marked the 
glittering spires and towers of Manoa, the City of the Sun; and 
&ldquo;Thither,&rdquo; said King Prigio, who had been explaining 
how matters stood, to Ricardo, &ldquo;we must ride, for I believe
they stand in great need of our assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had we not better go to Jaqueline first, sir?&rdquo; 
said Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;I think mine is the 
best plan.&nbsp; Manoa, whose golden spires and pinnacles are 
shining below us, is the City of the Sun, which Sir Walter 
Raleigh and the <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Spaniards could never find, so that 
men have doubted of its existence.&nbsp; We are needed there, to 
judge by that angry crowd in the marketplace.&nbsp; How they 
howl!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was on a strange sight that the king and Ricardo looked 
down from the Flying Horse.&nbsp; Beneath them lay the City of 
Manoa, filling with its golden battlements and temples a hollow 
of the mountains.&nbsp; Here were palaces all carved over with 
faces of men and beasts, and with twisted patterns of 
serpents.</p>
<p>The city walls were built of huge square stones, and among the
groves towered pyramids, on which the <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>people did 
service to their gods.&nbsp; From every temple top came the roar 
of beaten drums, great drums of serpentskin.</p>
<p>But, in the centre of the chief square of the town, was 
gathered a wild crowd of men in shining copper armour and helmets
of gold and glittering dresses of feathers.&nbsp; Among them ran 
about priests with hideous masks, crying them on to besiege and 
break down the royal palace.&nbsp; From the battlements of the 
palace the king&rsquo;s guardsmen were firing arrows and throwing
spears.&nbsp; The mob shot arrows back, some of them tipped with 
lighted straw, to burn the palace down.</p>
<p>But, in the very centre of the square, was a clear space of 
ground, on which fell the shadow of a tall column of red stone, 
all carved with serpents and faces of gods.&nbsp; Beside it stood
a figure horrible to see: a man <!-- page 188--><a 
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>clothed in 
serpent skins, whose face was the grinning face of a skull; but 
the skull was shining black and red in patches, and a long white 
beard flowed from beneath it.&nbsp; This man, mounted on a kind 
of altar of red stone, waved his hand and yelled, and seemed to 
point to the shadow of the column which fell across the 
square.</p>
<p>The people were so furious and so eager that they did not, at 
first, notice King Prigio as he slowly descended.&nbsp; But at 
last the eyes within the skull looked up and saw him, and then 
the man gave a great cry, rent his glittering dress of 
serpentskin, and held up his hands.</p>
<p>Then all the multitude looked up, and seeing the Flying Horse,
let their weapons fall; and the man of the skull tore it from his
face, and knelt before King Prigio, with his head in the 
dust.</p>
<p><!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Thou hast come, oh, Pachacamac, as is foretold 
in the prophecy of the Cord of the Venerable Knots!&nbsp; Thou 
hast come, but behold the shadow of the stone!&nbsp; Thou art too
late, oh Lord of the Earth and the Sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he pointed to the shadow, which, naturally, was growing 
shorter, as the sun drew near mid-day.</p>
<p>He spoke in the language of the ancient Incas of Peru, which 
of course Prigio knew very well; and he also knew that Pachacamac
was the god of that people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; Prigio said, with presence of mind,
&ldquo;as it has been prophesied of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riding on a beast that flies,&rdquo; said the old 
priest, &ldquo;even as the oracle declared.&nbsp; Glory to 
Pachacamac, even though we die to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what can I help my people?&rdquo; said Prigio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest; why should we instruct <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>thee?&nbsp;
Thou knowest that on midsummer-day, every year, before the shadow
shrinks back to the base of the <i>huaca</i> <a 
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190" 
class="citation">[190]</a> of Manoa, we must offer a maiden to 
lull the Earthquaker with a new song.&nbsp; Lo, now the shadow 
shrinks to the foot of the <i>huaca</i>, and the maid is not 
offered!&nbsp; For the lot fell on the daughter of thy servant 
the Inca, and he refuses to give her up.&nbsp; One daughter of 
his, he says, has been sacrificed to the sacred birds, the 
<i>Cunturs</i>: the birds were found slain on the hill-top, no 
man knows how; but the maiden vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it must have been Jaqueline.&nbsp; I killed the 
birds,&rdquo; said Ricardo, in Pantouflian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, not a word!&rdquo; said the king, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what makes you bear arms against the Inca?&rdquo; 
he asked the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would slay him and her,&rdquo; answered the priest; 
&ldquo;for, when the shadow shrinks to the <!-- page 191--><a 
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>foot of the
stone, the sun will shine straight down into the hollow hill of 
the Earthquaker, and he will waken and destroy Manoa and the 
Temples of the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wherefore would you slay them, when you must all 
perish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people, oh Pachacamac, would have revenge before 
they die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, folly of men!&rdquo; said the king, solemnly; then 
he cried: &ldquo;Lead me to the Inca; this day you shall not 
perish.&nbsp; Is it not predicted in the Cord of the Venerable 
Knots that I shall slay this monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten, oh Pachacamac, for the shadow shortens!&rdquo; 
said the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to the Inca,&rdquo; answered Prigio.</p>
<p>At this the people arose with a great shout, for they, too, 
had been kneeling; and, sending a flag of truce before King 
Prigio, the priest led him into the palace.&nbsp; The ground was 
<!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
192</span>strewn with bodies of the slain, and through them 
Prigio rode slowly into the courtyard, where the Inca was sitting
in the dust, weeping and throwing ashes on his long hair and his 
golden raiment.&nbsp; The king bade the priest remain without the
palace gates; then dismounted, and, advancing to the Inca, raised
him and embraced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come, a king to a king,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;My cousin, take courage; your sorrows are ended.&nbsp; If 
I do not slay the Earthquaker, sacrifice me to your 
gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prophecy is fulfilled,&rdquo; said the Inca, and 
wept for joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet thou must hasten, for it draws 
near to noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Prigio went up to the golden battlements, and saying no 
word, waved his hand.&nbsp; In a moment the square was empty, for
the people rushed to give thanks in the temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait my coming, my cousin,&rdquo; said Prigio <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>to
the Inca; &ldquo;I shall bring you back the daughter that was 
lost, when I have slain your enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inca would have knelt at his feet; but the king raised 
him, and bade him prepare such a feast as had never been seen in 
Manoa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lost are found to-day,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;be 
you ready to welcome them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, mounting the Flying Horse, with Dick beside him, he rose
towards the peak of the hill where the Earthquaker had his 
home.&nbsp; Already the ground was beginning to tremble; the 
Earthquaker was stirring in his sleep, for the maiden of the new 
song had not been sent to him, and the year ended at noon, and 
then he would rise and ruin Manoa.</p>
<p>The sun was approaching mid-day, and Prigio put spurs to the 
Flying Horse.&nbsp; Ten minutes more, and the sun would look 
straight down the crater of the hollow hill, and the Earthquaker 
<!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>would arouse himself when the light and the heat fell 
on his body.</p>
<p>Already the light of the sun shone slanting half-way down the 
hollow cone as the whirlpool of air caught the Flying Horse, and 
drew him swiftly down and down to the shadowy halls.&nbsp; There 
knelt and wept the nurses of the Earthquaker on the marble floor;
but Jaqueline stood a little apart, very pale, but not 
weeping.</p>
<p>Ricardo had leaped off before the horse touched the ground, 
and rushed to Jaqueline, and embraced her in his arms; and, oh! 
how glad she was to see him, so that she quite forgot her danger 
and laughed for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you have come, you have come; I knew you would 
come!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Then King Prigio advanced, the mighty weight in his hand, to 
the verge of the dreadful gulf of the Earthquaker.&nbsp; The dim 
walls grew radiant; a long slant arm of yellow light <!-- page 
195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
195</span>touched the black body of the Earthquaker, and a thrill
went through him, and shook the world, so that, far away, the 
bells rang in Pantouflia.&nbsp; A moment more, and he would waken
in his strength; and once awake, he would shatter the city walls 
and ruin Manoa.&nbsp; Even now a great mass of rock fell from the
roof deep down in the secret caves, and broke into flying 
fragments, and all the echoes roared and rang.</p>
<p>King Prigio stood with the mighty mass poised in his 
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; he cried; and he uttered the words of 
power, the magic spell that the dark Moon Lady had taught 
him.</p>
<p>Then all its invincible natural weight came into the mass 
which the king held, and down it shot full on the body of the 
Earthquaker; and where that had been was nothing but a vast 
abyss, silent, empty, and blank, and bottomless.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Far, far below, thousands of miles below, in the very 
centre of the earth, lay the dead Earthquaker, crushed flat as a 
sheet of paper, and the sun of midsummer-day shone straight down 
on the dreadful chasm, and could not waken him any more for 
ever.</p>
<p>The king drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupidity has saved the world,&rdquo; he said; and, 
with only strength to draw back one step from the abyss, he fell 
down, hiding his face in his hands.</p>
<p>But Jaqueline&rsquo;s arms were round his neck, and the 
maidens brought him water from an ice-cold spring; and soon King 
Prigio was himself again, and ready for anything.&nbsp; But 
afterwards he used to say that the moment when the Earthquaker 
stirred was the most dreadful in his life.</p>
<p>Now, in Manoa, where all the firm foundations of the city had 
trembled once, when the sun just <!-- page 197--><a 
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>touched the
Earthquaker, the people, seeing that the shadow of the sacred 
column had crept to its foot, and yet Manoa stood firm again, and
the Temple of the Sun was not overthrown, raised such a cry that 
it echoed even through the halls within the hollow hill.</p>
<p>Who shall describe the joy of the maidens, and how often 
Jaqueline and Ricardo kissed each other?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved me!&rdquo; she cried to the king, 
throwing her arms round him again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have saved 
Manoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> have saved the Hope of Pantouflia, not 
once or twice,&rdquo; said his Majesty, grandly.</p>
<p>And he told Dick how much he had owed to Jaqueline, in the 
fight with the Yellow Dwarf, and the fight with the Giant, for he
did not think it necessary to mention the affair at Rome.</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Then Dick kissed Jaqueline again, and all the maidens 
kissed each other, and they quite cried for gladness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we keep his Majesty the Inca waiting,&rdquo; said 
Prigio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Punctuality is the courtesy of kings.&nbsp; 
You ladies will excuse me, I am sure, if I remove first from the 
dungeon her whom we call the Princess Jaqueline.&nbsp; The Inca, 
her father, has a claim on us to this preference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then placing Jaqueline on the saddle, and leaving Dick to 
comfort the other young ladies, who were still rather nervous, 
the king flew off to Manoa, for the wind, of course, died with 
the death of the Earthquaker.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you the delight of all Manoa, and of the Inca, 
when they saw the Flying Horse returning, and recognised their 
long-lost princess, who rushed into the arms of her father.&nbsp;
They beat the serpent drums, for they <!-- page 199--><a 
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>had no 
bells, on the tops of the temples.&nbsp; They went quite mad with
delight: enemies kissed in the streets; and all the parents, 
without exception, allowed all the young people who happened to 
be in love to be married that very day.&nbsp; Then Prigio brought
back all the maidens, one after the other, and Dick last; and he 
fell at the Inca&rsquo;s feet, and requested leave to marry 
Jaqueline.</p>
<p>But, before that could be done, King Prigio, mounted on the 
palace balcony, made a long but very lucid speech to the 
assembled people.&nbsp; He began by explaining that he was not 
their God, Pachacamac, but king of a powerful country of which 
they had never heard before, as they lived very much withdrawn in
an unknown region of the world.&nbsp; Then he pointed out, in the
most considerate manner, that their religion was not all he could
wish, otherwise they would never sacrifice young ladies to wild 
birds and <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Earthquakers.&nbsp; He next sketched
out the merits of his own creed, that of the Lutheran Church; and
the Inca straightway observed that he proposed to establish it in
Manoa at once.</p>
<p>Some objection was raised by the old priest in the skull mask;
but when the Inca promised to make him an archbishop, and to 
continue all his revenues, the priest admitted that he was 
perfectly satisfied; and the general public cheered and waved 
their hats with emotion.&nbsp; It was arranged that the Inca, 
with his other daughters, should visit Pantouflia immediately, 
both because he could not bear to leave Jaqueline, and also 
because there were a few points on which he felt that he still 
needed information.&nbsp; The Government was left in the hands of
the archbishop, who began at once by burning his skull mask (you 
may see one like it in the British Museum, <!-- page 201--><a 
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>in the 
Mexican room), and by letting loose all the birds and beasts 
which the Manoans used to worship.</p>
<p>So all the young people were married in the Golden Temple of 
the Sun, and all the Earthquaker&rsquo;s nurses who were under 
thirty were wedded to the young men who had been fond of them 
before they were sent into the hollow hill.&nbsp; These young men
had never cared for any one else.&nbsp; Everybody wore bridal 
favours, all the unengaged young ladies acted as bridesmaids, and
such a throwing of rice and old shoes has very seldom been 
witnessed.&nbsp; As for the happy royal pair, with their fathers,
and the other princess (who did not happen to be engaged), back 
they flew to Pantouflia.</p>
<p>And there was Queen Rosalind waiting at the palace gates, and 
crying and laughing with pleasure when she heard that the wish of
her <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>heart was fulfilled, and Jaqueline 
was to be her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as for the Earthquaker,&rdquo; said her Majesty, 
&ldquo;I never was really anxious in the least, for I knew no 
beast in the world was a match for <i>you</i>, my 
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, just to make everything orderly and correct, Ricardo and 
Jaqueline were married over again, in the Cathedral of 
Pantouflia.&nbsp; The marriage presents came in afterwards, of 
course, and among them, what do you think?&nbsp; Why, the 
Seven-League Boots and the Sword of Sharpness, with a very polite
note of extraordinary size:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Giant who does not Know when he has had
Enough presents his hearty congratulations to the royal pair, and
begs to lay at their feet the Seven-league Boots (they not 
fitting me) and the Sword <!-- page 203--><a 
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>which 
Prince Ricardo left in the Giant&rsquo;s keeping recently.&nbsp; 
The Giant hopes <i>no bad blood</i>; and I am,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours very faithfully,<br />
&ldquo;THE G., &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;His little woman sends her 
congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you see the Giant was not such a bad sort of fellow after 
all, and Prince Ricardo always admitted that he never met a foe 
more gallant and good-humoured.</p>
<p>With such a clever wife, Ricardo easily passed all his 
examinations; and his little son, Prince Prigio (named after his 
august grandfather), never had to cry, &ldquo;Mamma, mamma, 
father&rsquo;s plucked again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they lived happily in a happy country, occasionally 
visiting Manoa; and as they possessed the magical Water o Life 
from the <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Fountain of Lions, I do not believe 
that any of them ever died at all, but that Prigio is still King 
of Pantouflia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need such kings should ever die!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
